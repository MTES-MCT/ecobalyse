Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Kraft paper {RER}| kraft paper production | Cut-off, S\n\nKraft paper is produced from chemical pulp produced in the kraft process. Kraft paper can be used for a number of flexible packaging applications such as paper sacks, wrapping papers and paper bags. Within kraft paper, Sack kraft paper is a porous kraft paper with high elasticity and high tear resistance, designed for packaging products with high demands for strength and durability. The data was collected specifically for Sack kraft paper but are representative for all kraft paper production. The dataset represents a mix of white (bleached) and brown (unbleached) paper.\n\nData in this model is from a study by CEPI Eurokraft in 2020.\n\nThe dataset represents average data calculated from several European Sack kraft paper mills and the production year 2018. Although the data was collected specifically for sack kraft paper production, discussions with the technical experts at the mills reveal that the data are applicable for other flexible kraft packaging papers\n\nThe majority of the mills in the study are integrated mills, but some \"semi-integrated mills\" were included, Semi-integrated mills are either an integrated mill that has been split into two companies (pulp production and paper production) where the pulp producer has not participated in the study. Or a production site where one type of paper is made from virgin pulp and the other type of paper is made from market pulp.\n\nThe energy sources at an integrated pulp and paper mills consists of external and internal fuels plus electricity from the grid and internally produced electricity. External fuels can be fossil or biobased. The internal fuels mainly consist of the black liquor and bark from the wood input for pulp production. Black liquor is the by-product of chemical pulping. It contains almost all of the inorganic cooking chemicals along with the lignin and other organic matter separated from the wood during pulping in the digester. The initial concentration of weak black liquor is about 15% dry solids in water. It is concentrated to firing conditions between 65% and 85% dry solids concentration. It is then burned in the \"Recovery boiler\". There are two purposes of burning the black liquor, one is to recover the inorganic cooking chemicals, the other is to make use of the energy in the organic portion of the black liquor. Source: Adams. T.N (editor) et al, \"Kraft recovery boilers\", 1997\n\nThe following air emissions were reported in the study: CO2 (fossil and biogenic), CH4 (fossil), N2O (fossil+ biogenic), CO (fossil+ biogenic), SO2, H2S, TRS, Total S, NOx, NH3, NMVOC, particles (all sizes), Pb and Hg. The listed air emissions are the most important emissions for the kraft paper production and cover all emissions at the mill, both from the cooking and recovering processes and combustion of fuels at different points at the plant.\n\nFor a more complete air emission profile for Sack kraft paper production, however, additional air emissions (beyond the ones listed above) were added for the combustion of the external fuels and internal using LCI datasets for combustion of different fuels as proxy. The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the external and internal fuels in the study and more information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\". No proxy was available for the combustion of black liquor, biological fibre slush, and tall oil. Emissions from these internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry.\n\nProduction volume: 1990144000 kg\nIncluded activities start: The process starts with the transports of wood and pulp to paper mill.\nIncluded activities end: The activity includes transports to paper mill, wood handling, chemical pulping, paper production, energy production on-site and internal waste water treatment.\nThe activity ends with the paper leaving the factory gate.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Average of present used technology in 2018\nStart date: 01/01/2018\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Statistics from CEPI Eurokraft for Sack production in Europe 2018.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 0.81 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of peanuts produced in India amounts to 30% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing peanuts produced in India for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 (i.e. very good).

The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included.

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Polyethylene, high density, granulate {RER}| polyethylene production, high density, granulate | Cut-off, S\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial HDPE production technologies: slurry suspension polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation and solution polymerisation using Ziegler-Natta, Philips, and Metallocene catalysts.\n\nHDPE is mainly produced with the slurry suspension, solution or the gas phase process, which belong to the low-pressure technologies. As catalysts, usually Ziegler-Natta or Phillips-type catalysts are applied, but metallocene-type catalysts can also be used. Due to this wide range of choice of process technology, reactor type, or catalyst type, a typical process for HDPE production cannot be defined.\n\nThe suspension polymerisation can be described as precipitation process. The formation of the polymer takes place in a hydrocarbon diluent and under conditions, where the monomer is soluble in the solution. The precipitated polymer, however, is insoluble and forms a fine suspension. The polymer is then separated by centrifugation. The suspension process can be combined with a stirred tank reactor or a loop reactor. Different diluents can be chosen, like C5 to C9 hydrocarbons, hexane, or isobutane.\n\nFor solution polymerisation, the hydrocarbon solvent (C9-C6) is kept at high temperature (>130 °C) to ensure that the formed polymer stays dissolved after production. In a subsequent step, the solvent is evaporated and recycled, and the liquid polymer can directly be sent to the extruder. \n\nIn the gas phase processes a fluidised bed of polymer particles and catalyst is maintained by a steady gaseous monomer feed from the bottom of the reactor. Polymer powder is continuously extracted at the bottom of the fluidised bed reactor. Unreacted monomer gas from the top is compressed and recycled to the reactor inlet. Catalyst, and co-catalyst if necessary, is also continuously fed to the reactor. Typically Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used for gas phase polymerisation where the catalyst is supported on inert silica particles so that the reaction takes place at the catalyst surface.\n\nAfter the reaction phase, most of the residual (unreacted) monomers (which are mostly present as gases) are separated from the polymer and are either recycled back into the process or flared of. Depending on the purity of the separated monomers, the gas can either be fed directly back into the production line or the monomers are returned to a purification unit. To limit the accumulation of impurities in the process, usually a small side-stream (purge) of the unreacted gas is sent back to the cracker or to a dedicated purification unit. After polymerisation, the polymer is usually fed di-rectly into a hot melt extruder, where additives can be added to the melted polymer if required. The polymer is then pelletised in an underwater pelletiser. The pelletised product is dried, blended where required and degassed.\n\nProduction volume: 6499999744 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with monomers and comonomers entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant.

The dataset includes all activities of a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (19 years, 1500 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Spain\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 1ff07dd7-9ff3-5c5e-9ba2-0b6d298e67d8_30df3cb7-d389-4007-a172-ad89e98c3270.spold\nUUID: 1ff07dd7-9ff3-5c5e-9ba2-0b6d298e67d8",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "Translated name: Mandarin, at farm (WFLDB 3.5)\nIncluded processes: The inventory includes all activities of a year in the productive phase of the orchard, i.e. fertiliser and pesticide application, mulching, mowing, harvesting and irrigation. Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on the farm. Direct field emissions from crop production activities and from land use change are considered. The establishment phase of the orchard, i.e. tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of mandarins. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year for the reference period of 2009 - 2012: yield (8.1 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 3303 m3/ha). System boundary: an average year of the productive phase is regarded; included are also the per year of lifetime calculated emissions for nursery, materials for planting, establishment and clearing phase; at farm without storage. Number of years from planting to clearing (lifetime): 30 years   - Waste treatment after clearing of the orchard: Wooden posts and tree wood go to incineration, concrete posts go to land fill, iron wires go to recycling. The data are representative for mandarin production in China used for the export market.\nComment: Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 2.8 (i.e. good quality)\n\nTechnology: Conventional production\nVersion: 2.2\nEnergy values: Undefined\nLocal category: Landwirtschaftliche Produktion\nLocal subcategory: Pflanzenbau\nSource file: ES_WFLDB_Mandarin_CN_08062015.xml",

What might be changing is the 1) type of refrigerant, 2) energy consumption - efficiency and 3) leakage of the refrigerant. \n\nThe datasets on transport, freight, lorry with refrigeration machine present in the ecoinvent database represent several scenarios with different type of refrigerant, energy consumption and leakage of the refrigerant.. \n\nThe technology level is set reflecting the EURO classification, i.e. EURO3 is the oldest technology and EURO6 the newest. The R134a refrigerant is currently most widely used refrigerant, while the carbon dioxide, liquid is the newer more environmentally friendly solution.

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Polymerisation of PVC is an exothermic reaction. The pressure in the reactor is usually in the range of 0.4 - 1.2 MPa and the reaction temperature is between 35 - 70°C. During the polymerisation reaction 85 - 97% of the VCM is converted into PVC. Residual VCM is removed by stripping the polymer suspension or latex. The unreacted monomer is recovered, liquefied, and returned to polymerisation\n\nFor the polymerisation process certain process chemicals are required. Surfactants, emulsifiers and protective colloids are used to prepare and stabilize the dispersion of monomer and PVC in process water (typically around 1 kg/t VCM in suspension and around 10-20 kg/t in emulsion). Organic peroxides or peresters are used as initiators (typically 1 kg/t VCM) for the production of suspension and microsuspension PVC, while e.g. hindered phenols are used to stop the reaction (typically < 1 kg/t VCM). For the production of emulsion PVC inorganic peroxides are common.\n\nPVC resin resulting from the suspension process (S-PVC) has a mean particle size of 50 - 200 µm. The essential differences between S-PVC grades result from the average length of polymer chains and from the porosity of the particles. Suspension PVC is always produced batch wise in a stirred vessel. The monomer is dispersed in demineralised water by the combination of mechanical stirring and surfactants. The polymerisation takes place inside the VCM droplets under the influence of VCM soluble initiators such as peresters, percarbonates, or peroxides.\n\nProduction volume: 3400000000 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with monomers entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\nIncluded activities end: Activity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Coverage of production capacity in Europe: 88%\nStart date: 01/01/2013\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Data was collected for the year 2013, processed in 2014 and published in 2015\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 9.3.0.0\nCreated: 9/19/2018 9:57:32 AM\nLast edited: 9/28/2020 9:15:38 AM\nSource: e00f2823-2447-5bb8-8ecd-9b611005ae4b_e69cca3a-6e2a-4638-b9e7-09927dcf1c95.spold\nUUID: e00f2823-2447-5bb8-8ecd-9b611005ae4b",

It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nCO2 emissions have been recalculated from the carbon content in raw materials and fuels.\n\nMaterial inputs are estimation based on literature sources and a Swiss production site. Energy and water consumption, emissions, and waste production are estimation based on literature sources. Infrastructure is an estimation based on average European packaging glass factories.\n\nProduction volume: 12807795712 kg\nIncluded activities start: From the reception of precursors silica sand, soda, unsorted glass cullets, limestone, dolomite, feldspar, and chemicals  inorganics at the factory gate.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the production of 1 kg of white packaging glass. The dataset includes material and energy inputs, water consumption, emissions to air and water, waste production, transport and infrastructure.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe without Germany and Switzerland\nTechnology level: Old\nTechnology: Packaging glass is produced in a two stage moulding process with pressing and blowing techniques. The whole process is fully automatic and consists of five different stages:\n\nNone\n\n1.\tProduction of a molten glass piece (gob) with correct weight and temperature. \n\nNone\n\nNone\n\n2.\tForming of the primary shape in a first mould (blank mould) with compressed air pressure\n\nNone\n\n3.\tTransfer to the final mould (finish mould)\n\nNone\n\n4.\tBringing the shaping process to an end by blowing the container with compressed air until the shape of the final mould\n\nNone\n\n5.\tPost forming processes\n\nThe melting process is the central one. As the first glass forming material, sand, has a very high melting point. Soda as a fluxing agent is used to reduce the melting temperature. When heating soda, this is decomposed into sodium oxide Na2O, the actual fluxing agent, and into carbon dioxide that is released. Metal oxides in form of limestone (CaCO3 that decomposes to CaO), dolomite (-> Ca- and Mg-Oxides), feldspar are used as stabilizators and therefore to improve the hardness and chemical resistance of glass. For white glass  decolouring agents are added.\nStart date: 01/01/2000\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 108.3.0.0\nCreated: 7/28/2010 6:15:27 PM\nLast edited: 7/19/2013 3:57:43 PM\nSource: 3ef52cf5-aadc-5d2a-bfd6-096ca0bda9ee_c3fd9530-3e9b-44b5-8833-9e544937a6e9.spold\nUUID: 3ef52cf5-aadc-5d2a-bfd6-096ca0bda9ee",

The esterification process is carried out under moderate pressure (2.5-5.5 bar) and at high temperature (230-270 °C) whilst the water formed during the reaction is continuously removed via distillation. \n\nThe monomers of PET production, purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and mono ethylene glycol (MEG) are polymerised in the liquid phase to produce amorphous PET. This form of the polymer is suitable for the production of fibres and film. Most bottle grade PET today is a copolyester slightly modified through addition of 1-2% Benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (isophthalic acid, IPA) or 4(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexyl-methanol (cyclohexanedimethanol, CHDM) during polymerisation.\n\nThe first step of PET production is the esterification of PTA and MEG to bishydroxyethyl terepthalate (BHET) with water as a by-product at around 220-260 °C in the presence of an anti-mony catalyst (usually Sb2O3). Water forming from the esterification reaction is continuously removed by distillation. Formation of the undesired side product diethylene glycol is suppressed by maintaining low molar ratios of MEG:PTA (less than 2 or even 1.5). BHET is then sent to Pre-polycondensation in a second reactor under a vacuum and further to a melt polycondensation reactor at higher temperatures and still under vacuum. Vacuum is required to remove water and other side products and to drive the reaction equilibrium towards the polymer.\n\nAs melt polymerisation does not produce high molecular weight, a subsequent polymerisation step, solid state polymerisation (SSP) is required for bottle grade PET. During SSP the polymer chain lengths are increased by heat in the absence of oxygen and water, by means of either vacuum or purging with an inert gas to drive off the by-products of reactions. The reaction is driven by temperature, pressure, and the diffusion of by-products from the interior of the pellet to the surface. The product of SSP is a partially crystalline resin that can be used to produce bottles via injection moulding and stretch blow moulding.\n\nProduction volume: 3400000000 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with PTA entering the polymerisation plant. Both amorphous and bottle grade PET produciton are included. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\nIncluded activities end: Activity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Coverage of production capacity in Europe: 85%\nStart date: 01/01/2015\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Data was collected for the year 2015, processed in 2016 and published in 2017\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 9/19/2018 9:57:29 AM\nLast edited: 1/10/2019 9:25:51 AM\nSource: 4f3acb8f-af33-5b3c-a750-8176c10ad5f1_19bacec1-aff8-4398-a7bd-d125b48505b7.spold\nUUID: 4f3acb8f-af33-5b3c-a750-8176c10ad5f1",

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 4; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 37 t/ha. The data are representative for lemons production in Spain used for the export market. §\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of lemons produced in Spain amounts to 16% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing lemons produced in Spain for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.3 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 674371008 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (30 years, 256 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers (mineral and organic) and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Spain\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 141b6513-212b-57ec-ae15-603da8d7cc04_9891d347-28f8-434d-896a-84a19a4c68a6.spold\nUUID: 141b6513-212b-57ec-ae15-603da8d7cc04",

To build this deforestation-free mix for France, the brazilian states with primary forest to arable land transformation flows were discarded and the production shares of the 3 states retained for this deforestation-free mix were normalized to 100%.\n____________________________\n\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Mandarin {ES}| mandarin production | Cut-off, U\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of mandarins. The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 30 t/ha. The data are representative for mandarin production in Spain used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 200-80-270 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 13.86 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of mandarins produced in Spain amounts to 33% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing mandarins produced in Spain for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 3.0 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 2046639488 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (30 years, 256 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers (mineral and organic) and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Spain\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 17398bf7-2418-5f30-9906-414fbe829028_9c6b672a-661e-40c3-a9a0-902b33cc6871.spold\nUUID: 17398bf7-2418-5f30-9906-414fbe829028",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

They are mainly based in Saint-Guénolé, Concarneau and Douarnenez but a few units are present around Bayonne. They go out at night for 8 to 10 hours fishing trips and spend between 150 and 200 days at sea per year. Their fishing area is off the French Atlantic coasts. They use the seine technique and land other pelagic species such as mackerel, anchovy and horse-mackerel. Sardines are landed whole and fresh in the ships' french home ports.\nStock status : The Bay of Biscay sardine stock is considered overfished : F/Fmsy = 1,34 (ICES 2017 data ; overfished if F/Fmsy >1). \nPressure on stocks indicator : 3,73E-07 (94,7% of catch taken into account). This indicator is based on scientific publications and was applied to the ICV Pêche project's fisheries.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The publication is published and freely available with comprehensive supporting information:\n\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es2030577\n\nFranziska Stoessel, Ronnie Juraske, Stephan Pfister, Stefanie Hellweg. (2012) Life Cycle Inventory and Carbon and Water FoodPrint of Fruits and Vegetables: Application to a Swiss Retailer. Environmental Science & Technology 6(46) 3253-3262.\n\nNone\n\nThis activity was adapted to include the global average land use change (LUC) emissions according 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants 'WFLDB-adapted-Blonk 2014 direct-land-use-change-assessment-tool_2015-05-18a.xlsx', tab. 'Country & land use unknown'. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nProduction volume: 57559834624 kg\nIncluded activities start: From seedling production.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with harvest and storage. \nThe dataset includes a storage period of 0.3 month and it's use of electricity. It also includes the electricity use in the greenhouse. And an average amount of heating energy for the production and the seedling production is included.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The functional unit is the production of 1 kg sugar from sugarcane.\n\nAllocation: Based on economic allocation: sugar (84.3%), bagasse (0.3%), ethanol (4.6%) and vinasse (10.8%). Allocation is done according to carbon balance for CO2 emissions.\n\nSystem Boundaries: Cradle-to-gate. This multi-output process covers the production of sugar, bagasse, ethanol and vinasse. The inventory includes the transport of sugarcane to the sugar refinery and the processing of sugarcane to sugar, ethanol (95% w/w), bagasse (79% dry matter, excess), and vinasse from ethanol production. System boundary is at the sugar refinery. Treatment of waste effluents is not included (most wastewater is spread over the fields nearby). Packaging is not included.\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 3.0, Good quality\n\nGeography: Global average, extrapolated from Brazilian practice.\n\nTechnology: Juice extraction is performed through milling (not diffusion). The juice is then purified and crystallized to sugar according to standard processes. Ethanol is produced by standard fermentation and distillation techniques. Energy supply is done by combustion of the bagasse resulting from the extraction stage. The two main products are sugar and ethanol.\n\nTime: Data from 1994 to 2006, current technology for the production of ethanol from sugarcane\n\nData sources:\n- Weidema B.P., Bauer C., Hischier R., Mutel C., Nemecek T., Reinhard J., Vadenbo C.O., Wernet G.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,75; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 2; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 2; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.\n\nThis is the market for  'heat, central or small-scale, natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\n\nThe shares of heat supplying activities with combined heat and power (CHP) plants and pure heat power plants have been estimated. On a small level, more heat is produced in heat plants than in CHP plants. The shares are assumed to amount to 25% heat from CHP plants and 75% heat from heat plants. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. \n\nThis product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through the burning of natural gas in heat and power co-generation units and several types of boilers. The dataset is targeted for central or small-scale heating.\n\nProduction volume: 5742101266432 MJ\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'heat, central or small-scale, natural gas',  within the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, natural gas', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe without Switzerland\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2011\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 3.3.0.0\nCreated: 7/25/2013 2:46:26 PM\nLast edited: 7/26/2013 4:52:09 PM\nSource: 0e907453-c114-510d-ad1e-ecbb40d020f1_b3c58f5d-5815-487c-8b9c-4366e00d22dc.spold\nUUID: 0e907453-c114-510d-ad1e-ecbb40d020f1",

Rapport méthodologique : volet emballages Agribalyse 3.2.\n\nThe inventory refers to a \"APET/PE tray\" and the associated elements allowing to condition a weight between 150g and 200g of lardoons. \nApplication to other cases: This inventory of packaging solution can only be used for products in sub-category \"Lardoons\" (PACK_AGB) : refer to the report for more details. This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside the sub-category \"Lardoons\" (PACK_AGB).\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing of two references and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nTwo references were weighed to best represent the French market. They are marketed both under own brand and under private label.\nThe weight of 175g of product used was obtained by averaging two references of 150g and 200g. The weight of the packaging corresponds to the average of the weighed packaging.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

Direct field emissions from crop production activities and from land use change are considered. The establishment phase of the orchard, i.e. tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase. \nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of apples. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year for the reference period of 2009 - 2012: yield (16.783 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 12249 m3/ha). System boundary: an average year of the productive phase is regarded; included are also the per year of lifetime calculated emissions for nursery, materials for planting, establishment and clearing phase; at farm without storage. Number of years from planting to clearing (lifetime): 15 years   - Waste treatment after clearing of the orchard: Wooden posts and tree wood go to incineration, concrete posts go to land fill, iron wires go to recycling.

The data are representative for onion production in China, Gansu province, used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 200-240-75 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 10.6 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of onions produced in China amounts to 9% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing onions produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.0 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 38596923392 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing seedlings, i.e. seedlings from roots.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of onions at farm gate. The dataset includes total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown.

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Polypropylene, granulate {RER}| polypropylene production, granulate | Cut-off, S\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial PP production technologies: slurry suspension polymerisation,Bulk suspension polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation using Ziegler-Natta and Metallocene catalysts\n\nPP is usually manufactured with the gas phase or the suspension (slurry) process. Modern suspension processes, however, use liquid monomers instead of a solvent and are termed bulk process.\n\nIn the gas phase processes a fluidised bed of polymer particles and catalyst is maintained by a steady gaseous monomer feed from the bottom of the reactor. Polymer powder is continuously extracted at the bottom of the fluidised bed reactor. Unreacted monomer gas from the top is compressed and recycled to the reactor inlet. Catalyst, and co-catalyst if necessary, is also continuously fed to the reactor. Typically Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used for gas phase polymerisation where the catalyst is supported on inert silica particles so that the reaction takes place at the catalyst surface.\n\nThe suspension polymerisation can be described as precipitation process. The formation of the polymer takes place in a hydrocarbon diluent and under conditions, where the monomer is soluble in the solution. The precipitated polymer, however, is insoluble and forms a fine suspension. The polymer is then separated by centrifugation. The suspension process can be combined with a stirred tank reactor or a loop reactor. Different diluents can be chosen, like C5 to C9 hydrocarbons, hexane, or isobutane.\n\nThe bulk suspension process describes the slurry suspension process used for the production of PP where the monomer propylene is used as solvent instead of other hydrocarbons. Modern suspension processes for the production of PP use liquid monomers instead of gaseous.\n\nAfter the reaction phase, most of the residual (unreacted) monomers (which are mostly present as gases) are separated from the polymer and are either recycled back into the process or flared of. Depending on the purity of the separated monomers, the gas can either be fed directly back into the production line or the monomers are returned to a purification unit. To limit the accumulation of impurities in the process, usually a small side-stream (purge) of the unreacted gas is sent back to the cracker or to a dedicated purification unit. After polymerisation, the polymer is usually fed di-rectly into a hot melt extruder, where additives can be added to the melted polymer if required. The polymer is then pelletised in an underwater pelletiser. The pelletised product is dried, blended where required and degassed.\n\nProduction volume: 11000000512 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with monomers and comonomers entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\nIncluded activities end: Activity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Coverage of production capacity in Europe: 76%\nStart date: 01/01/2011\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Data was collected for the year 2011, processed in 2013 and published in 2014\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 9/19/2018 9:57:30 AM\nLast edited: 1/10/2019 9:25:51 AM\nSource: 13f5ec09-b1e6-538f-95b4-780399213404_66ca2f38-5e51-4546-83c0-d7cef0c55c7c.spold\nUUID: 13f5ec09-b1e6-538f-95b4-780399213404",

Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on farm. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation and seeds are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered.\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of potato. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2003 - 2013 (15.5 t/ha) produced under irrigated conditions (921 m3/ha total water). The data are representative for potato production in from northwest China, which is not representative for export.\nComment: Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown.

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) only the main packaging material (in contact with the product) ; (2) the transport for packaging supply (ratio FR and ratio RER) ; (3) only the main process ; (4) the end of life of the main packaging material.\n\nFunctional unit: 1kg of packaged food product\n\nThe packaging solutions mentioned as PROXY PACK have been developed with a simplified approach but are based on datasets from PACK-AGB project. These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled.

This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 18370729984 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of the carrots and their transport to the farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Rest-of-World\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 8.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 6/23/2016 1:43:54 PM\nSource: ddeb35ee-c0f2-5574-aab9-b73d097c1477_ed50040b-8630-4560-9b12-dd6cb2c9d741.spold\nUUID: ddeb35ee-c0f2-5574-aab9-b73d097c1477",

The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nProduction volume: 18174699520 kg\nIncluded activities start: From seedling production.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with harvest and storage. \nThe dataset includes a storage period of 1 month and it's use of electricity.  \nAnd the greenhouse heating energy for the seedling production. The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). Mercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included. The dataset doesn't include infrastructure for production and storage facilities. No transports for agricultural means of production from the regional storage to the farm are included.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Global\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Integrated production\nStart date: 01/01/2010\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 10.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/12/2011 8:33:22 AM\nLast edited: 7/22/2016 11:03:50 AM\nSource: b32a069e-3d31-5bd3-b3cf-410bdc498544_d2ad7fe5-59ef-47c9-adff-d7c5ab93ee70.spold\nUUID: b32a069e-3d31-5bd3-b3cf-410bdc498544",

Rapport méthodologique : volet emballages Agribalyse 3.2.\n\nThe inventory refers to an XPS tray with plastic film and the associated elements making it possible to condition a total weight of 250 g (format) of dried fruits.\nThis packaging solution inventory can only be used for products in the \"dried fruits\" subcategory (PACK_AGB): refer to the report for more details. This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside of the \"dried fruits\" subcategory (PACK_AGB)\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE)\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html \n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 5; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 3; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

For the 3 processes, the machineries have been excluded since we consider a lifetime of 10 years for the appliances, and a large batch size.\n_Frying : The process includes electricity consumption and cooking oil consumption. It does not include air emissions life-cycle, by lack of data. The appliance life-cycle was excluded from the scope.\n_Boiling : The process includes electricity consumption and cooking oil consumption. It does not include air emissions life-cycle, by lack of data.  The appliance life-cycle was excluded from the scope.\nThe process includes electricity consumption. It excludes air emission due to lack of data. The appliance life-cycle was excluded from the scope.\nIn the development of Agribalyse 3.0, the upstream life-cycle stages of the food product, downstream life cycle stages and packaging from gate to consumer are added separately.\n\n_Energy consumption : The energy consumption data was found consistent with basic thermal calculations based on BREF generic data. For boiling (blanching), the energy consumption for gas boiling has been averaged between the data presented for potato blanching and the data presented for pasta boiling (Fusi et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2012). For frying, the energy consumption has been extracted from a study on potato frying as French fries (Mouron et al., 2016).\n_Additional ingredients : Additional ingredients accounted for are tap water, for boiling, and rapeseed oil, for frying.\n_Emissions : Emissions to air (water from boiling) and emissions to water are included for boiling process\n_Waste management : or the frying process, used oil is collected separately to be purified. According to the decree on 12th July 201, the collection of used cooking oil is mandatory in order to recycle it (Legifrance, 2011). In January 2016, the obligation threshold was lowered at 60 tons per year, meaning this obligation is applicable to a large amount of food industries.  We used the ecoinvent dataset: \"Used vegetable cooking oil, purified (FR) treatment of used vegetable cooking oil, purification, Cut-off, U - Copied from Ecoinvent\". The geographical scope for the ecoinvent dataset is French specific and covers all the end of life process: collection, transport, effluent treatment, storage and credits for the recovered oil. Other solid wastes are out of scope (Appliances at end of life and maintenance and cleaning material).\n_Transport : we used \"market for\" datasets already (transportation already included in these datasets). \n_",

The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991.

The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%).

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\nThis dataset is gate-to-gate and covers all stages from peeled fruit or vegetable to canned fruit or vegetable: slicing of fruit or vegetable, can filling and sterilization. It is assumed to take place in France. Consequently, all datasets are chosen for France and Europe, when not available for France.\nThe figure below represents the life cycle boundaries.\nThe downstream stages from plant gate to consumer are out of scope, in accordance with the Agribalyse 3.0 methodology. The following stages are excluded from the system:\no The washing of fruit and vegetable prior to canning (excluded in Agribalyse 3.0 LCIs)\no The production and EoLof packaging, included elsewhere in upstream or downstream LCIs in Agribalyse v3.0\n\nThe figure represents the system modelling.\n\nA review of bibliography has been done to collect data on canning processes, along with an interview with a French canning process expert. The expert reviewed and validated the data collected from literature. Our research on vegetables led to compiling five studies, calculating the average electricity, steam and water consumption for each step of the canning process. For fruits, we reviewed the data for peach canning, which amounted to a single study (Folinas et al., 2015). The data was considered not robust enough, leading to excluding fruit canning from the scope of the model.\n_From the bibliography and the interview with a canning expert, we derived the energy consumptions for the vegetable canning process see section 8. One study provided the total energy consumption for canning (steam and electricity), it was used as a reference (Rao, 1977).  As explained previously, considering that water and steam circulates in a closed loop throughout the process, only the energy for pumping and heating water has been considered in the modelling of the water circuit.\n_The canning process involves water and steam consumption. However, according to the data provided by our canning process expert, water and steam are processed within a closed loop. Thus, water consumption for steam, cooling and other processes was not included in the scope. In order to calculate the water quantity in the cans, we calculated an average among data from Openfoodfacts website (Google Play app, 2019)\n_In the Cradle to Consumer Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Accounting of Sweet Corn in Minnesota (Miller, 2017) considers the addition of 7,27 g of salt per kg of canned corn. This value has been adopted after validation by our canning expert.\n_The food losses at the sub-steps of the process have not been modelled. The loss are modelled at a global process level. Therefore, a 1% default loss rate is applied at the end of the process. This is a conservative approach since all flows are augmented by 1%. The resulting waste (food, water and salt) are included in the inventory.\n_Emissions are related to solid waste due to the global product loss. Consequently, 1% of input food, water and salt are treated at the end of life.\n_ Transportation is not modelled in the inventory, as it is already accounted for in the electricity and salt inventories. The electricity inventory is an ecoinvent \"market\" inventory accounting for electricity transportation, and the salt Acyvia inventory relies on an ecoinvent sodium chloride \"market\" inventory.\n_ The packaging life cycle is not included. The future practitioner will be in charge of adding the appropriate packaging manufacture and end of life, as well as the 1% loss rate related to the canning process.",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "Dairy farm archetype IT-154 according to FAO, IDF, IFCN (2014).\nIT-154 represents an average-sized farm in northern Italy (Lombardy), having Holstein cows with a milk yield of 8 810 kg milk/cow per year. The cows are kept in a free stall barn where milking is done in a parlour system. The farm operates on 72 ha of land that is very fertile and can also be used for cash crops. About 56 percent of the work on the farm is done by family members.\n\nAllocation between milk and meat (live animals) based on bio-physical causality (IDF 2015)\nInventory is for 1 kg raw milk, uncorrected. Mass produced is given for FPCM equivalent (IDF 2015)\nCo-product is beef cattle, from dairy farm (culled cows and male calves).\n\nIncluded: all feed inputs, pasture and pasture-related emissions, enteric emissions.\nExcluded: milking, farm infrastructure and energy/water consumption, manure management, packaging, transport for raw milk collection.\n\nHence the raw milk archetypes datasets are intended to be used in the raw milk national mix datasets, where manure management, farm processes and local peat degradation are also combined. The inventory is presented for 1 kg uncorrected raw milk, but the output quantity is corrected to correspond to 1 kg of FPCM.\n\n1 kg FPCM (fat and protein corrected milk)\n1 kg LW (live weight) beef cattle, from dairy farm\nMilk yield = 8810 kg year-1 cow-1\nNumber of dairy cows per farm = 154\nNumber of heifers per farm = 118 (avg)\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 ( i.e. very good quality)",

Drying is not applied systematically (assumption 10% of Yield_ is dried). Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on farm. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation and seeds are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered.\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of sunflower grains, at standard water content required for storage (9%). The reference flow is the average Yield_ per ha and year, from 2006 - 2010, which is 2.4 t/ha with an average irrigation of 24 m3 water/ha (4% of the sunflower fields are irrigated irrigated, receiving 600 m3/ha water).

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

'Country & land use unknown'. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991.

It also includes the electricity use in the greenhouse. And an average amount of heating energy for the production and the seedling production is included. The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). \nMercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included.

The reference flow is the average Yield_ per ha and year, from 2006 - 2009: Yield_ (165 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 4748 m3/ha). The data are representative of loose classic tomatoes for fresh consumption, produced in Spain (Almeria) for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 798-506-1562 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 32.3 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of fresh grade tomatoes produced in Spain amounts to 10.4 % of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing fresh grade tomatoes produced in Spain for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.0 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 4255320576 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with harvest and transport to the farm gate. Storage is not included. \nThe dataset includes all activities during a cycle, i.e. all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations include: soil cultivation, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Irrigation is included, as well as greenhouses infrastructures and energy consumption when relevant. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Spain\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2006\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Time period referring to the data source: 2006-2009.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Rapport méthodologique : volet emballages Agribalyse 3.2.\n\nThe inventory refers to a \"PP pot\" and the associated elements allowing to condition a weight of 200g of cocktail sausages. \nApplication to other cases: This inventory of packaging solution can only be used for products in sub-category \"Cocktail sausages\" (PACK_AGB) : refer to the report for more details. This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside the sub-category \"Cocktail sausages\" (PACK_AGB).\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing of two references and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nTwo references were weighed to best represent the French market. They are marketed both under own brand and under private label.\nThe weight of 200g of product used was obtained by averaging two references of 200g each. The weight of the packaging corresponds to the average of the weighed packaging.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 48.2 t/ha. The data are representative for pear production in Belgium used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 36-0-21 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 2.56 m3/ha of liquid manure and 1.71 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 26.15 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of pear produced in Belgium amounts to 12% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing pear produced in Belgium for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 3.0 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 277274240 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (21 years, 2357 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Belgium\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 0b7ef9ff-f6c6-5386-a8de-ab1b0efaefc2_fb2a172f-2a59-4990-b362-64dd4825550f.spold\nUUID: 0b7ef9ff-f6c6-5386-a8de-ab1b0efaefc2",

Farms have Yield_ of 1701.66 kg dried matter per ha for this crop cycle. The system boundaries include the production of all of crop inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, crop protection products, and fuel). There is an estimated 0.49 kg of N fixation per tonne of lentils produced in this region that can be included as an avoided use of N fertilizer for the next crop in the rotation. However, this was not included in this model due to data presentation restrictions. Irrigation is not included since it is rarely performed for lentils in this region. Sowing date for the crop is May, 2019 and harvesting date is August, 2020. Seeding rate is 0.06 kg/tonne of lentil production.

The soil is prepared for cultivation in 1st week of May and sowing of seeds started about 5 days after soil preparation.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with lentil drying to <16% moisture at farm gate. Carbon and nitrogen emissions associated with above- and below-ground biomass are accounted for using the DNDC model. This model was also used to calculate a nitrogen fixation credit that can be included as an avoided use of N fertilizer for the next crop in the rotation.

The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 3; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 2; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year (1710 kg/ha) produced under non-irrigated conditions. The dataset represents a mix of red and green lentils with a ratio of 75/25 red/green based on registered sales rates.\n\nAllocation: No allocation\n\nSystem boundaries: Cradle-to-gate. The inventory includes inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, and seeds, as well as field work processes and the associated diesel combusted in agricultural machinery. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are included. After harvesting, lentils are transferred to a storage bin close to the farm, where they are mechanically dried by aeriation to maintain safe storage. Lentil straw has no economic value, and is not harvested, therefore no co-product or residue treatment is accounted for.\n\nData quality rating: 1.2 (i.e. excellent quality)\n\nGeography: The dataset describes the production of lentils in Saskatchewan and Alberta provinces in Canada\n\nTechnology: Conventional production\n\nTime: 2012-2017\n\nData sources:\n1.

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Apricot {FR}| apricot production | Cut-off, U\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of apricots. The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 20 t/ha. The data are representative for apricots production in France used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 60-20-75 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 1 m3/ha of liquid manure and 1 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 5.6 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of apricots produced in France amounts to 19% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing apricots produced in France for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.8 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 171400752 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years, 500 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers (mineral and organic) and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for France\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 8.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 1:14:46 PM\nLast edited: 11/20/2018 11:42:18 AM\nSource: f3d574bc-5aae-5792-b0e9-f469b2592c98_bfbebb42-d443-4cc1-8300-7dbf18a85a0b.spold\nUUID: f3d574bc-5aae-5792-b0e9-f469b2592c98",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Corrugated board box {RER}| corrugated board box production | Cut-off, S\n\nCorrugated Board is manufactured from several specially conditioned layers of recycled or virgin papers, with the Fluting Medium being the middle layer and Linerboard used for the outside layers. Reels of Fluting Medium and Linerboard are fed into a machine which is called a Corrugator (FEFCO, 2018). In integrated plants such as the ones represented here, the finished board is further folded into boxes.\n\nhttps://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/fb7c96f2-1933-4a81-a33a-515d0a5fb151 [Image URL, right click copy paste to a browser to view]\n\nThe data on corrugated board production are based on 389 plants (mostly integrated plants with corrugated board and box production on the same site) in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Together they produced 12,100,000 tonnes saleable product, which is 54% of the total annual production of corrugated board products in Europe. Each of the production sites produces on average 31.100 tonnes of corrugated sheets, ranging from 5.000  500.000 tonnes each. Reference(s): https://www.fefco.org/sites/default/files/documents/LCA%20Report%202019_revised_%20p%2037.pdf, accessed September 2022.\n\nFor this dataset the European average of recycled and virgin paper inputs (wellenstoff, semichemical fluting, kraftliner, testliner) was used.\n\nThe following air emissions were reported in the study: CO2 (fossil), CO, NOx (as NO2), SOx (as SO2), particulates (all sizes).\n\nFor a more complete air emission profile, additional air emissions (beyond the ones listed above) were added for the combustion of the external fuels and internal using LCI datasets for combustion of different fuels as proxy. The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the external fuels in the study and more information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\".\n\nThe production volume is valid for the year 2018. Inventory data were collected for the year 2018.\n\nProduction volume: 24306999296 kg\nIncluded activities start: The process starts as reels of Fluting Medium and Linerboard are fed into a machine called a Corrugator.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with folded corrugated board boxes ready for delivery.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Average of present used technology\n\nThe Fluting Medium paper is conditioned with heat and steam and fed between large corrugating rolls that give the paper its fluted shape in the Single Facer. Starch is applied to the tips of the flutes on one side and the inner liner is glued to the fluting. The corrugated fluting medium with liner attached to it is called single face web and travels along the machine towards the Double Backer where the single face web meets the outer liner and forms corrugated board. A number of layers of single faced web may be built up to produce double and triple wall corrugated board. The corrugated board is slit into the required widths and cut into sheets which are then stacked or palletised. The final stage of the process consists of printing and then slotting, folding and gluing the corrugated board to manufacture a corrugated box.\nStart date: 01/01/2018\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 4.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/31/2022 8:55:02 AM\nLast edited: 8/15/2022 1:20:58 PM\nSource: aefe6f41-eeb4-5d24-8d8a-bfc4777b1ee5_ca213807-7c00-4537-ac8c-23d39d0f2bd5.spold\nUUID: aefe6f41-eeb4-5d24-8d8a-bfc4777b1ee5",

'Country & land use unknown'. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nProduction volume: 23176521728 kg\nIncluded activities start: From maintenance of the orchards after harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with harvest and storage. \nThe dataset includes a storage period of 0.6 month and it's use of electricity.  And for the production, mulch films are included and disposed according to the disposal techniques used in the production country. The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). Mercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included. The dataset doesn't include infrastructure for production and storage facilities. No transports for agricultural means of production from the regional storage to the farm are included.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Global\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Production without production standard, but according to GAP\nStart date: 01/01/2010\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 10.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/3/2011 9:33:27 AM\nLast edited: 7/22/2016 11:03:50 AM\nSource: 58c20a5f-1797-5113-8663-015b0829c168_596ca18d-28a7-46db-bf11-2064b03879d2.spold\nUUID: 58c20a5f-1797-5113-8663-015b0829c168",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Cow milk {CA-QC}| milk production, from cow | Cut-off, U\n\nThis dataset represents the production of conventional milk from dairy cows, in Québec (Canada), in 2009-2011. The module includes the consumption of feed, and the operation of cattle housing systems for the management of the dairy herd and the production of cow milk. The functional unit is 1 kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) raw milk from Québec dairy farms. The FPCM correction is made for a conversion to a 4.0% fat and 3.3% true protein content, following the equation provided by the International Dairy Federation (IDF): FPCM (kg/yr) = Production (kg/yr) x [0.1226 x Fat% + 0.0776 x Protein% + 0.2534]. Live animals (culled cows and calves) sold for slaughterhing are by-products, as well as solid and liquid manure.\n\nhttps://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/f08a0b12-8f8b-4f1d-8b52-1d688403d0cc [Image URL, right click copy paste to a browser to view]\n\nThe average dairy farm in Québec produced 449400 L raw milk (at 4.06 kg/hL butterfat and 3.36 kg/hL protein), hence 469488 kg FCPM per farm. The average herd size over the year is: 57,7 milk cows (8137 kg FPCM/cow/year), 0.18 bulls, 0.39 young bulls, 1.11 veals male, 10.72 veals female, 12.56 bred heifers, 14.90 open heifers. Hence, the whole herd is worth 74 livestock units. 11 culled cows and 41 calves are sold for slaughter. The replacement rate is 32%. 91% of animals are housed in tie-stall systems, 9% in free-stall systems. With 6414 dairy farms, Québec milk production accounts for 38% of overall Canada production.\n\nThis dataset does not cover organic milk production in Quebec, which is marginal. 1.5% of overall Quebec dairy farms were organic-certified in 2010, and 1% of total milk produced in Québec in 2010 was organic milk (Fédération des Producteurs de lait du Québec; http://www.lait.org/en/interactive-faq/the-production.php). Furthermore, only 80% of organic milk ends up into organic-certified processed products (e.g. organic milk, yogurt, cheese)\n\n44% of the manure is managed as solid manure (35% solid stored; 9% stockpiled) and 56% managed as liquid manure (35% liquid in open-pit with crust formation; 8% liquid in covered pit; 8% liquid in open-pit without crust; and 5% liquid in lagoon). According to these management figures and to the distribution of animal categories within the herd, emissions to the air from manure management have been calculated (in kg/kg FPCM): N2O (direct+indirect): 5,7866E-04 kg; NH3: 5,5310E-04 kg; CH4: 5,5198E-03 kg.\n\nNone\n\nProduction volume: 3011295488 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts from the reception and storage of feed materials, and dairy herd housing.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the provision of milk at farm, ready-to-deliver. The dataset includes the consumption of feed; the livestock management operations (including bedding, drinking water, milking equipment, cleaning products and water, ammonia and dinitrogen oxyde emissions from housing, and methane emissions from enteric fermentation), manure management emissions; energy and buildings (including electricity for dairying, cattle housing and milk parlour equipment and buildings, and gasoline for regular operations) necessary for the operation of a typical dairy farm. The dataset does not include fodder and feed production and processing into meal for animals, litter production, manure management operations (however, emissions are accounted for); nor milk transportation beyond the farm gate (e.g. to dairy processing plants). Also, the dataset does not include particulate matter emissions, nor any drugs used on the dairy farm, because of the lack of data available on quantities and content. In terms of mass, drugs represent much less than 1% of inputs.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Québec\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Data and assumptions are intended to reflect current equipment, processes, and market conditions.\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Period indicated in the reference. \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 12/27/2013 4:18:13 PM\nLast edited: 9/11/2015 9:22:02 PM\nSource: e57e3840-4395-53b5-ba24-eb7b672200cf_a3ee1ec6-ce17-430e-a475-f98f1b2890d2.spold\nUUID: e57e3840-4395-53b5-ba24-eb7b672200cf",

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 3.5 t/ha. The data are representative for peanut production in China used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 80-27-28 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 11.25 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of peanuts produced in China amounts to 10% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing peanuts produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 15861245952 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of peanuts at farm gate. The dataset includes total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for China\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 35bb2b10-af2d-5436-9267-3204130d2a25_a578a3e7-fcbb-4662-8e6b-85b05fe8e310.spold\nUUID: 35bb2b10-af2d-5436-9267-3204130d2a25",

The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 1.1 t/ha. The data are representative for tea production in China used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 35-10-10 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 10.63 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of tea produced in China amounts to 15% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing tea produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 3.2 (i.e. fair quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 1436769536 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), and the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: fertiliser and pesticide application, and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n   Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Rest-of-World\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 9.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 6/23/2016 1:45:52 PM\nSource: 006744b2-04db-53aa-b425-7b2466dabd96_1942f3d1-fad9-43da-a657-d5920c804cd6.spold\nUUID: 006744b2-04db-53aa-b425-7b2466dabd96",

It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.\n\nFor more information on the process, please go to \n\nhttp://primary.world-aluminium.org/index.php?id=285\n\n[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nProduction volume: 2096486016 kg\nIncluded activities start: The unit process begins with the unloading of process material to their storage areas on site.
