    "comment": "This dataset represents the production of 1 tonne of dried fava bean (<16% moisture) during May-August, 2020, at 2089.05 ha faba bean farms located in the Province of Alberta, Canada. Yield values were averaged over 2018-2020, and farms have an average yield of 4598.52 kg grain (<16% moisture) per ha for these crop cycles. The system boundaries include the production of all crop inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, crop protection products, and fuel) and consider nitrogen credits derived from biological N fixation associated with dried faba bean production. Irrigation is included. The sowing date for the crop is May 2020 and the harvesting date is August 2020. The seeding rate is 55.35 kg/tonne of faba bean production. Fertilizer applied contain nitrogen (as N) 1.40 kg/tonne, phosphate (as P2O5) 2.46 kg/tonne, potash (as K2O) 0.90 kg/tonne, and sulfur (as S) 0.31 kg/tonne. Predominant crop protection applied contain active ingredients of glyphosate 0.066 kg/tonne, bentazon 0.064 kg/tonne, and diquat dibromide 0.048 g/tonne. Machinery is used for tillage, seeding, fertilizer application, rolling, herbicide application, fungicide application, harvest aid application, harvesting, and other with total fuel consumption of 7.12 kg/tonne.\n\nProduction volume: 9606569.08304765 kg\nIncluded activities start: Starting inputs for this activity include seed, fertilizer, crop protection products and fuel on the farm. This activity begins with soil preparation about 37 weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in 1st week of May and the sowing of seeds started about 5 days after soil preparation.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with faba bean drying to <16% moisture at farm gate. This takes place in August, 19 weeks after the activity start. The activity includes the infrastructures and use of agricultural machinery.\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Alberta\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Production of faba bean includes farm practices from tillage, seeding, fertilizer application, rolling, herbicide application, fungicide application, harvest aid application, harvesting, and other field operations, to aeration and drying.\nStart date: 01/01/2020\nEnd date: 31/12/2024\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Soil cultivating date for the main crop: May 2020; Harvesting date for the main crop: August 2020. Total time from the date of sowing to the date of harvesting comes to 19 weeks. Yield data were collected and averaged for three crop cycles (2018-2020).

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Kraft paper {RER}| kraft paper production | Cut-off, S\n\nKraft paper is produced from chemical pulp produced in the kraft process. Kraft paper can be used for a number of flexible packaging applications such as paper sacks, wrapping papers and paper bags. Within kraft paper, Sack kraft paper is a porous kraft paper with high elasticity and high tear resistance, designed for packaging products with high demands for strength and durability. The data was collected specifically for Sack kraft paper but are representative for all kraft paper production. The dataset represents a mix of white (bleached) and brown (unbleached) paper.\n\nData in this model is from a study by CEPI Eurokraft in 2020.\n\nThe dataset represents average data calculated from several European Sack kraft paper mills and the production year 2018. Although the data was collected specifically for sack kraft paper production, discussions with the technical experts at the mills reveal that the data are applicable for other flexible kraft packaging papers\n\nThe majority of the mills in the study are integrated mills, but some \"semi-integrated mills\" were included, Semi-integrated mills are either an integrated mill that has been split into two companies (pulp production and paper production) where the pulp producer has not participated in the study. Or a production site where one type of paper is made from virgin pulp and the other type of paper is made from market pulp.\n\nThe energy sources at an integrated pulp and paper mills consists of external and internal fuels plus electricity from the grid and internally produced electricity. External fuels can be fossil or biobased. The internal fuels mainly consist of the black liquor and bark from the wood input for pulp production. Black liquor is the by-product of chemical pulping. It contains almost all of the inorganic cooking chemicals along with the lignin and other organic matter separated from the wood during pulping in the digester. The initial concentration of weak black liquor is about 15% dry solids in water. It is concentrated to firing conditions between 65% and 85% dry solids concentration. It is then burned in the \"Recovery boiler\". There are two purposes of burning the black liquor, one is to recover the inorganic cooking chemicals, the other is to make use of the energy in the organic portion of the black liquor. Source: Adams. T.N (editor) et al, \"Kraft recovery boilers\", 1997\n\nThe following air emissions were reported in the study: CO2 (fossil and biogenic), CH4 (fossil), N2O (fossil+ biogenic), CO (fossil+ biogenic), SO2, H2S, TRS, Total S, NOx, NH3, NMVOC, particles (all sizes), Pb and Hg. The listed air emissions are the most important emissions for the kraft paper production and cover all emissions at the mill, both from the cooking and recovering processes and combustion of fuels at different points at the plant.\n\nFor a more complete air emission profile for Sack kraft paper production, however, additional air emissions (beyond the ones listed above) were added for the combustion of the external fuels and internal using LCI datasets for combustion of different fuels as proxy. The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the external and internal fuels in the study and more information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\". No proxy was available for the combustion of black liquor, biological fibre slush, and tall oil. Emissions from these internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry.\n\nProduction volume: 1990144000 kg\nIncluded activities start: The process starts with the transports of wood and pulp to paper mill.\nIncluded activities end: The activity includes transports to paper mill, wood handling, chemical pulping, paper production, energy production on-site and internal waste water treatment.\nThe activity ends with the paper leaving the factory gate.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Average of present used technology in 2018\nStart date: 01/01/2018\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Statistics from CEPI Eurokraft for Sack production in Europe 2018.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The weight of the packaging corresponds to the average of the weighed packaging.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 0.81 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of peanuts produced in India amounts to 30% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing peanuts produced in India for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 (i.e. very good).

The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included.

The reference flow is the average Yield_ per ha and year, from 2009 - 2012: Yield_ (35.1 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 13705 m3/ha). The data are representative for banana production in India used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 57-0-146 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 1.84 m3/ha of liquid manure and 2.48 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 4.2 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of bananas produced in India amounts to 0.4% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010).

The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds.

Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.

The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Polyethylene, high density, granulate {RER}| polyethylene production, high density, granulate | Cut-off, S\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial HDPE production technologies: slurry suspension polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation and solution polymerisation using Ziegler-Natta, Philips, and Metallocene catalysts.\n\nHDPE is mainly produced with the slurry suspension, solution or the gas phase process, which belong to the low-pressure technologies. As catalysts, usually Ziegler-Natta or Phillips-type catalysts are applied, but metallocene-type catalysts can also be used. Due to this wide range of choice of process technology, reactor type, or catalyst type, a typical process for HDPE production cannot be defined.\n\nThe suspension polymerisation can be described as precipitation process. The formation of the polymer takes place in a hydrocarbon diluent and under conditions, where the monomer is soluble in the solution. The precipitated polymer, however, is insoluble and forms a fine suspension. The polymer is then separated by centrifugation. The suspension process can be combined with a stirred tank reactor or a loop reactor. Different diluents can be chosen, like C5 to C9 hydrocarbons, hexane, or isobutane.\n\nFor solution polymerisation, the hydrocarbon solvent (C9-C6) is kept at high temperature (>130 °C) to ensure that the formed polymer stays dissolved after production. In a subsequent step, the solvent is evaporated and recycled, and the liquid polymer can directly be sent to the extruder. \n\nIn the gas phase processes a fluidised bed of polymer particles and catalyst is maintained by a steady gaseous monomer feed from the bottom of the reactor. Polymer powder is continuously extracted at the bottom of the fluidised bed reactor. Unreacted monomer gas from the top is compressed and recycled to the reactor inlet. Catalyst, and co-catalyst if necessary, is also continuously fed to the reactor. Typically Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used for gas phase polymerisation where the catalyst is supported on inert silica particles so that the reaction takes place at the catalyst surface.\n\nAfter the reaction phase, most of the residual (unreacted) monomers (which are mostly present as gases) are separated from the polymer and are either recycled back into the process or flared of. Depending on the purity of the separated monomers, the gas can either be fed directly back into the production line or the monomers are returned to a purification unit. To limit the accumulation of impurities in the process, usually a small side-stream (purge) of the unreacted gas is sent back to the cracker or to a dedicated purification unit. After polymerisation, the polymer is usually fed di-rectly into a hot melt extruder, where additives can be added to the melted polymer if required. The polymer is then pelletised in an underwater pelletiser. The pelletised product is dried, blended where required and degassed.\n\nProduction volume: 6499999744 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with monomers and comonomers entering the polymerisation plant.

The data are representative for asparagus production in China for the export market based on average data over the country. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 80-60-40 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 0.17 m3/ha of liquid manure and 0.14 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 3.6 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of asparagus produced in China amounts to 88% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing asparagus produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.8 (i.e. good quality).

The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the asparagus field including the establishment phase (2 years) per year of lifetime (9 years). \nThe establishment phase of the asparagus field includes the nursery, manual planting, soil cultivation (plough), fertilisation (manure) and PE foil. \nThe productive phase of the asparagus field includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation, fertiliser and pesticide application, manual harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the field is cleared by removing the asparagus roots.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of asparagus crowns (seedlings), fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown.

The average Yield_ from 2013 is 750 kg/ha. The data are representative for vanilla production in Madagascar used for the export market. No mineral NPK fertiliser are applied. No organic fertilisers are applied. No pesticides are applied.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of vanilla produced in the Madagascar could not be assessed within this project. The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing vanilla produced in the Madagascar for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.7 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 2888000 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery of vanilla plants.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of vanilla at farm gate. The dataset includes all activities of a year in the productive phase (8 years) and transport on farm. Activities in the establishment phase (3 years) include manual planting. Activities in the productive phase include harvest of vanilla plants. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The dataset doesn't include a) irrigation, fertilisers or pesticides, because they are not applied due to extensive production where cultivation is done mainly manually b) materials for the planting, establishment and clearing phase, and c) drying because vanilla is dried at ambient temperature. Direct field emissions in this prodcution system are not caused by fertilizer or pesticide inputs from humjan activity but are related to deposition of nutrients, nutrient content of the soil and erosion.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Madagascar\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2013\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 3.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: c5e3316d-0a18-5722-b867-758c3f749f2d_43fdfa7d-a9ad-4919-8368-e82a9142101b.spold\nUUID: c5e3316d-0a18-5722-b867-758c3f749f2d",

Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on the farm. Direct field emissions from crop production activities and from land use change are considered. The establishment phase of the orchard, i.e. tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of mandarins. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year for the reference period of 2009 - 2012: yield (8.1 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 3303 m3/ha). System boundary: an average year of the productive phase is regarded; included are also the per year of lifetime calculated emissions for nursery, materials for planting, establishment and clearing phase; at farm without storage. Number of years from planting to clearing (lifetime): 30 years   - Waste treatment after clearing of the orchard: Wooden posts and tree wood go to incineration, concrete posts go to land fill, iron wires go to recycling. The data are representative for mandarin production in China used for the export market.\nComment: Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 2.8 (i.e. good quality)\n\nTechnology: Conventional production\nVersion: 2.2\nEnergy values: Undefined\nLocal category: Landwirtschaftliche Produktion\nLocal subcategory: Pflanzenbau\nSource file: ES_WFLDB_Mandarin_CN_08062015.xml",

This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Polyvinylchloride, suspension polymerised {RER}| polyvinylchloride production, suspension polymerisation | Cut-off, S\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial S-PVC production technologies\n\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) is manufactured by polymerisation of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Polymerisation of PVC is an exothermic reaction. The pressure in the reactor is usually in the range of 0.4 - 1.2 MPa and the reaction temperature is between 35 - 70°C. During the polymerisation reaction 85 - 97% of the VCM is converted into PVC. Residual VCM is removed by stripping the polymer suspension or latex. The unreacted monomer is recovered, liquefied, and returned to polymerisation\n\nFor the polymerisation process certain process chemicals are required. Surfactants, emulsifiers and protective colloids are used to prepare and stabilize the dispersion of monomer and PVC in process water (typically around 1 kg/t VCM in suspension and around 10-20 kg/t in emulsion). Organic peroxides or peresters are used as initiators (typically 1 kg/t VCM) for the production of suspension and microsuspension PVC, while e.g. hindered phenols are used to stop the reaction (typically < 1 kg/t VCM). For the production of emulsion PVC inorganic peroxides are common.\n\nPVC resin resulting from the suspension process (S-PVC) has a mean particle size of 50 - 200 µm. The essential differences between S-PVC grades result from the average length of polymer chains and from the porosity of the particles. Suspension PVC is always produced batch wise in a stirred vessel. The monomer is dispersed in demineralised water by the combination of mechanical stirring and surfactants. The polymerisation takes place inside the VCM droplets under the influence of VCM soluble initiators such as peresters, percarbonates, or peroxides.\n\nProduction volume: 3400000000 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with monomers entering the polymerisation plant.

This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside the sub-category \"Beef and veal\" (PACK_AGB).\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing of two references and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nThree references were weighed to best represent the French market. They are all marketed under own brand.\nThe weight of 244g of product used was obtained by averaging three references of 194g, 234g and 304g. The weight of the packaging corresponds to the average of the weighed packaging.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nCO2 emissions have been recalculated from the carbon content in raw materials and fuels.\n\nMaterial inputs are estimation based on literature sources and a Swiss production site. Energy and water consumption, emissions, and waste production are estimation based on literature sources. Infrastructure is an estimation based on average European packaging glass factories.\n\nProduction volume: 12807795712 kg\nIncluded activities start: From the reception of precursors silica sand, soda, unsorted glass cullets, limestone, dolomite, feldspar, and chemicals  inorganics at the factory gate.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the production of 1 kg of white packaging glass. The dataset includes material and energy inputs, water consumption, emissions to air and water, waste production, transport and infrastructure.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe without Germany and Switzerland\nTechnology level: Old\nTechnology: Packaging glass is produced in a two stage moulding process with pressing and blowing techniques. The whole process is fully automatic and consists of five different stages:\n\nNone\n\n1.\tProduction of a molten glass piece (gob) with correct weight and temperature. \n\nNone\n\nNone\n\n2.\tForming of the primary shape in a first mould (blank mould) with compressed air pressure\n\nNone\n\n3.\tTransfer to the final mould (finish mould)\n\nNone\n\n4.\tBringing the shaping process to an end by blowing the container with compressed air until the shape of the final mould\n\nNone\n\n5.\tPost forming processes\n\nThe melting process is the central one. As the first glass forming material, sand, has a very high melting point. Soda as a fluxing agent is used to reduce the melting temperature. When heating soda, this is decomposed into sodium oxide Na2O, the actual fluxing agent, and into carbon dioxide that is released. Metal oxides in form of limestone (CaCO3 that decomposes to CaO), dolomite (-> Ca- and Mg-Oxides), feldspar are used as stabilizators and therefore to improve the hardness and chemical resistance of glass. For white glass  decolouring agents are added.\nStart date: 01/01/2000\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 108.3.0.0\nCreated: 7/28/2010 6:15:27 PM\nLast edited: 7/19/2013 3:57:43 PM\nSource: 3ef52cf5-aadc-5d2a-bfd6-096ca0bda9ee_c3fd9530-3e9b-44b5-8833-9e544937a6e9.spold\nUUID: 3ef52cf5-aadc-5d2a-bfd6-096ca0bda9ee",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Polyethylene terephthalate, granulate, bottle grade {RER}| polyethylene terephthalate production, granulate, bottle grade | Cut-off, S\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial bottle grade PET production technologies. PET production covered by this study is by esterification of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid (PTA). The esterification process is carried out under moderate pressure (2.5-5.5 bar) and at high temperature (230-270 °C) whilst the water formed during the reaction is continuously removed via distillation. \n\nThe monomers of PET production, purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and mono ethylene glycol (MEG) are polymerised in the liquid phase to produce amorphous PET. This form of the polymer is suitable for the production of fibres and film. Most bottle grade PET today is a copolyester slightly modified through addition of 1-2% Benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (isophthalic acid, IPA) or 4(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexyl-methanol (cyclohexanedimethanol, CHDM) during polymerisation.\n\nThe first step of PET production is the esterification of PTA and MEG to bishydroxyethyl terepthalate (BHET) with water as a by-product at around 220-260 °C in the presence of an anti-mony catalyst (usually Sb2O3). Water forming from the esterification reaction is continuously removed by distillation. Formation of the undesired side product diethylene glycol is suppressed by maintaining low molar ratios of MEG:PTA (less than 2 or even 1.5). BHET is then sent to Pre-polycondensation in a second reactor under a vacuum and further to a melt polycondensation reactor at higher temperatures and still under vacuum. Vacuum is required to remove water and other side products and to drive the reaction equilibrium towards the polymer.\n\nAs melt polymerisation does not produce high molecular weight, a subsequent polymerisation step, solid state polymerisation (SSP) is required for bottle grade PET. During SSP the polymer chain lengths are increased by heat in the absence of oxygen and water, by means of either vacuum or purging with an inert gas to drive off the by-products of reactions. The reaction is driven by temperature, pressure, and the diffusion of by-products from the interior of the pellet to the surface. The product of SSP is a partially crystalline resin that can be used to produce bottles via injection moulding and stretch blow moulding.\n\nProduction volume: 3400000000 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with PTA entering the polymerisation plant. Both amorphous and bottle grade PET produciton are included. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\nIncluded activities end: Activity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Coverage of production capacity in Europe: 85%\nStart date: 01/01/2015\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Data was collected for the year 2015, processed in 2016 and published in 2017\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 9/19/2018 9:57:29 AM\nLast edited: 1/10/2019 9:25:51 AM\nSource: 4f3acb8f-af33-5b3c-a750-8176c10ad5f1_19bacec1-aff8-4398-a7bd-d125b48505b7.spold\nUUID: 4f3acb8f-af33-5b3c-a750-8176c10ad5f1",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The inventory includes inputs of organic fertilisers and seedlings. According to ACi, most farmers do not engage in pest control and fertiliser application during the plantation of cashew trees. Planting, harvesting and other field activities are manually handled, and a first drying under the sun is considered. Direct field emissions from manure application and land use change are included. Direct emissions from crop residues management are also considered, assuming 50% of the residues are spread on field and 50% are composted in non-aerated heaps.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 4; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The data are representative for lemons production in Spain used for the export market. §\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of lemons produced in Spain amounts to 16% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing lemons produced in Spain for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.3 (i.e. good quality).

The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (30 years, 256 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers (mineral and organic) and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Spain\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 141b6513-212b-57ec-ae15-603da8d7cc04_9891d347-28f8-434d-896a-84a19a4c68a6.spold\nUUID: 141b6513-212b-57ec-ae15-603da8d7cc04",

To build this deforestation-free mix for France, the brazilian states with primary forest to arable land transformation flows were discarded and the production shares of the 3 states retained for this deforestation-free mix were normalized to 100%.\n____________________________\n\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 30 t/ha. The data are representative for mandarin production in Spain used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 200-80-270 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 13.86 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of mandarins produced in Spain amounts to 33% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing mandarins produced in Spain for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 3.0 (i.e. good quality).

The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (30 years, 256 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers (mineral and organic) and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.\n\nThis is the market for  'tap water', in the geography of South Africa.\n\nTransport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nProduction volume: 4149318516736 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts from tap water, under pressure, at tap water treatment plant and fed into the tap water distribution network.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with 1 kg of water at consumer (industrial or household).\n\nThis dataset includes: \n - the distribution network\n - water losses during transmission \n\nThis dataset doesn't include\n - energy used during distribution for additional pressure. The tap water is already under pressure when fed into the network (see corresponding tap water production datasets). The implicit assumption is that no additional energy is required during distribution to overcome loss of load in the distribution network. This assumption is not always correct.\n - emissions to groundwater associated with water leaving the distribution network through leaks. These are assumed to be inconsequential since we are dealing with treated tap water.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for South Africa\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2012\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: The production volumes associated with potable water production are based on 2014 production volume. \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 3.3.0.0\nCreated: 11/16/2017 9:46:40 AM\nLast edited: 6/25/2019 5:27:50 PM\nSource: 225afa82-6a6e-541d-9739-d1dcd62f1a20_c5adb1fb-872e-4446-a3bb-c4b61aa4bd45.spold\nUUID: 225afa82-6a6e-541d-9739-d1dcd62f1a20",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

They are mainly based in Saint-Guénolé, Concarneau and Douarnenez but a few units are present around Bayonne. They go out at night for 8 to 10 hours fishing trips and spend between 150 and 200 days at sea per year. Their fishing area is off the French Atlantic coasts. They use the seine technique and land other pelagic species such as mackerel, anchovy and horse-mackerel. Sardines are landed whole and fresh in the ships' french home ports.\nStock status : The Bay of Biscay sardine stock is considered overfished : F/Fmsy = 1,34 (ICES 2017 data ; overfished if F/Fmsy >1). \nPressure on stocks indicator : 3,73E-07 (94,7% of catch taken into account). This indicator is based on scientific publications and was applied to the ICV Pêche project's fisheries.

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Rapport méthodologique : volet emballages Agribalyse 3.2.\n\nThe inventory refers to a \"APET/PE tray\" and the associated elements allowing to condition a weight of 250g of beef or veal. \nApplication to other cases: This inventory of packaging solution can only be used for products in sub-category \"Beef and veal\" (PACK_AGB) : refer to the report for more details. This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside the sub-category \"Beef and veal\" (PACK_AGB).\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing of one reference and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nThe weighed reference is representative of the French market.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

Rapport méthodologique : volet emballages Agribalyse 3.2.\n\nThe inventory refers to an stand up bag with a zipper closure and the associated elements making it possible to condition a total weight of 250 g (format) of dried fruits.\nThis packaging solution inventory can only be used for products in the \"dried fruits\" subcategory (PACK_AGB): refer to the report for more details. This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside of the \"dried fruits\" subcategory (PACK_AGB)\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE)\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html \n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,75; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 3; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

'Country & land use unknown'. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991.

It also includes the electricity use in the greenhouse. And an average amount of heating energy for the production and the seedling production is included. The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). Mercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included.  \nThe dataset doesn't include infrastructure for production and storage facilities.

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2009 - 2012: yield (493 kg/ha) obtained under non-irrigated conditions. The data are representative for cocoa beans production in Indonesia used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 66-88-55 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 7.7 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of cocoa beans produced in Indonesia amounts to 16 % of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing cocoa beans produced Indonesia for the export market. \n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.2 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 7.7672725E8 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e.grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (50 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Machine use and infrastructure are excluded as most of the work is assumed to be manual work. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees. On-site fermentation and sun-drying of the cocoa beans are included.\nWaste treatment after the clearing of the orchard includes the incineration of tree wood. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The functional unit is the production of 1 kg sugar from sugarcane.\n\nAllocation: Based on economic allocation: sugar (84.3%), bagasse (0.3%), ethanol (4.6%) and vinasse (10.8%). Allocation is done according to carbon balance for CO2 emissions.\n\nSystem Boundaries: Cradle-to-gate. This multi-output process covers the production of sugar, bagasse, ethanol and vinasse. The inventory includes the transport of sugarcane to the sugar refinery and the processing of sugarcane to sugar, ethanol (95% w/w), bagasse (79% dry matter, excess), and vinasse from ethanol production. System boundary is at the sugar refinery. Treatment of waste effluents is not included (most wastewater is spread over the fields nearby). Packaging is not included.\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 3.0, Good quality\n\nGeography: Global average, extrapolated from Brazilian practice.\n\nTechnology: Juice extraction is performed through milling (not diffusion). The juice is then purified and crystallized to sugar according to standard processes. Ethanol is produced by standard fermentation and distillation techniques. Energy supply is done by combustion of the bagasse resulting from the extraction stage. The two main products are sugar and ethanol.\n\nTime: Data from 1994 to 2006, current technology for the production of ethanol from sugarcane\n\nData sources:\n- Weidema B.P., Bauer C., Hischier R., Mutel C., Nemecek T., Reinhard J., Vadenbo C.O., Wernet G.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

All the exchanges are calculated per kg of palm date and are based on field data from the main industrial palm date exporter in Tunisia. The inventory includes the following activities: sorting, washing, fumigating, cooling, heating, drying and glucosing. The packaging has not been taking into account.Regarding waste management, palm date kernel are recovered as animal feed. The annual productivity of the plant is 13000 tons of palm dates Deglet Noor (97% of the plam dates are conventionals). The cultivar of the dates studies is Deglet Noor. Tunisia is the world's largest exporter of Deglet Noor.\n\nProduction volume: 5574121 kg\nIncluded activities start: The activity starts when palm date fruit arrives to the plant in order to be conditioned.\nIncluded activities end: The activity ends when the fruit has undergone all processing steps.

Average Yield_ per hectare and year: 4.15 t/ha, obtained under irrigated conditions. \n\nAllocation: No allocation\n\nSystem boundaries: Cradle-to-gate. The study collected data from 20 farms. In this region, the quinoa is produced on a yearly rotation with quinoa cultivated during the winter and another crop during the summer (e.g., pumpkin, onion, maize, etc.). Machinery is used only for primary tillage (ploughing), secondary tillage (disc harrow) and for the furrowing. Sowing is handled manually. Fertilizers are used and applied by fertigation through the drip irrigation system. Herbicides are applied before sowing, then insecticides and fungicides, as well as pH correctors and growth regulators. Pesticides are considered to be applied by small sprayers and manually. The  harvest is done by hand and then the quinoa is dried in the sun. The threshing is done mechanically by a rice tresher with container capacity of 850 kg. The straw is usually reincorportated in the field or can be burned (depending on what is the following crop cultivated). Reincorporation is assumed in the current dataset and handled mechanically. LUC is included. \n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 1.2, Excellent quality\n\nGeography: Peru, region of Arequipa (Majes)\n\nTechnology: Conventional production with medium inputs and mechanization level.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,75; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 2; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 2; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.\n\nThis is the market for  'heat, central or small-scale, natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\n\nThe shares of heat supplying activities with combined heat and power (CHP) plants and pure heat power plants have been estimated. On a small level, more heat is produced in heat plants than in CHP plants. The shares are assumed to amount to 25% heat from CHP plants and 75% heat from heat plants. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. \n\nThis product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through the burning of natural gas in heat and power co-generation units and several types of boilers. The dataset is targeted for central or small-scale heating.\n\nProduction volume: 5742101266432 MJ\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'heat, central or small-scale, natural gas',  within the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, natural gas', to the consumers of this product.

    "comment": "Translated name: Pear, at farm (WFLDB 3.5)\nIncluded processes: The inventory includes all activities of a year in the productive phase of the orchard, i.e. fertiliser and pesticide application, mulching, mowing, harvesting and irrigation. Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on the farm. Direct field emissions from crop production activities and from land use change are considered. The establishment phase of the orchard, i.e. tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase. \nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of pear. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year for the reference period of 2009 - 2012: yield (13.9 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 11085 m3/ha). System boundary: an average year of the productive phase is regarded; included are also the per year of lifetime calculated emissions for nursery, materials for planting, establishment and clearing phase; at farm without storage. Number of years from planting to clearing (lifetime): 20 years   - Waste treatment after clearing of the orchard: Wooden posts and tree wood go to incineration, concrete posts go to land fill, iron wires go to recycling. The data are representative for pear production in China used for the export market.\nComment: Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 2.8 (i.e. good quality)\n\nTechnology: Conventional production\nVersion: 2.2\nEnergy values: Undefined\nLocal category: Landwirtschaftliche Produktion\nLocal subcategory: Pflanzenbau\nSource file: ES_WFLDB_pearCN_12062015.xml",

This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside the sub-category \"Lardoons\" (PACK_AGB).\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing of two references and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nTwo references were weighed to best represent the French market. They are marketed both under own brand and under private label.\nThe weight of 175g of product used was obtained by averaging two references of 150g and 200g. The weight of the packaging corresponds to the average of the weighed packaging.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.\n\nThe geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.\n\nSum of regional production volumes: 3.971e+10 kg\n\nCN: PV = 2.268e+10 kg; weight = 0.5712\n\nIN: PV = 1.540e+10 kg; weight = 0.3878\n\nNL: PV = 1.402e+9 kg; weight = 0.03531\n\nNZ: PV = 2.245e+8 kg; weight = 5.653e-3\n\nYield of the global dataset = 43838.9116255 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional Yield_s.\n\nThe comments below were part of the CN regional dataset.\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of onions The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2010 is 60 t/ha. The data are representative for onion production in China, Gansu province, used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 200-240-75 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 10.6 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of onions produced in China amounts to 9% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing onions produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.0 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 38596923392 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing seedlings, i.e. seedlings from roots.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of onions at farm gate. The dataset includes total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Rest-of-World\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2004\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 6/23/2016 1:44:33 PM\nSource: 2e6ffc64-bbba-5b84-b2d8-799bf1c73546_1945897f-c0a2-4dbf-8397-9fd93e6a9445.spold\nUUID: 2e6ffc64-bbba-5b84-b2d8-799bf1c73546",

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.\n\nThis is the market for  'tap water', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\n\nTransport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nProduction volume: 478151998177280 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts from tap water, under pressure, at tap water treatment plant and fed into the tap water distribution network.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with 1 kg of water at consumer (industrial or household).\n\nThis dataset includes: \n - the distribution network\n - water losses during transmission \n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include\n - energy used during distribution for additional pressure. The tap water is already under pressure when fed into the network (see corresponding tap water production datasets). The implicit assumption is that no additional energy is required during distribution to overcome loss of load in the distribution network. This assumption is not always correct.\n - emissions to groundwater associated with water leaving the distribution network through leaks. These are assumed to be inconsequential since we are dealing with treated tap water.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe without Switzerland\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2012\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 4.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/27/2014 5:18:38 PM\nLast edited: 6/25/2019 5:27:50 PM\nSource: 20508f01-bf98-5c04-ad84-214facac8ba8_c5adb1fb-872e-4446-a3bb-c4b61aa4bd45.spold\nUUID: 20508f01-bf98-5c04-ad84-214facac8ba8",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Polypropylene, granulate {RER}| polypropylene production, granulate | Cut-off, S\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial PP production technologies: slurry suspension polymerisation,Bulk suspension polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation using Ziegler-Natta and Metallocene catalysts\n\nPP is usually manufactured with the gas phase or the suspension (slurry) process. Modern suspension processes, however, use liquid monomers instead of a solvent and are termed bulk process.\n\nIn the gas phase processes a fluidised bed of polymer particles and catalyst is maintained by a steady gaseous monomer feed from the bottom of the reactor. Polymer powder is continuously extracted at the bottom of the fluidised bed reactor. Unreacted monomer gas from the top is compressed and recycled to the reactor inlet. Catalyst, and co-catalyst if necessary, is also continuously fed to the reactor. Typically Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used for gas phase polymerisation where the catalyst is supported on inert silica particles so that the reaction takes place at the catalyst surface.\n\nThe suspension polymerisation can be described as precipitation process. The formation of the polymer takes place in a hydrocarbon diluent and under conditions, where the monomer is soluble in the solution. The precipitated polymer, however, is insoluble and forms a fine suspension. The polymer is then separated by centrifugation. The suspension process can be combined with a stirred tank reactor or a loop reactor. Different diluents can be chosen, like C5 to C9 hydrocarbons, hexane, or isobutane.\n\nThe bulk suspension process describes the slurry suspension process used for the production of PP where the monomer propylene is used as solvent instead of other hydrocarbons. Modern suspension processes for the production of PP use liquid monomers instead of gaseous.\n\nAfter the reaction phase, most of the residual (unreacted) monomers (which are mostly present as gases) are separated from the polymer and are either recycled back into the process or flared of. Depending on the purity of the separated monomers, the gas can either be fed directly back into the production line or the monomers are returned to a purification unit. To limit the accumulation of impurities in the process, usually a small side-stream (purge) of the unreacted gas is sent back to the cracker or to a dedicated purification unit. After polymerisation, the polymer is usually fed di-rectly into a hot melt extruder, where additives can be added to the melted polymer if required. The polymer is then pelletised in an underwater pelletiser. The pelletised product is dried, blended where required and degassed.\n\nProduction volume: 11000000512 kg\nIncluded activities start: Acitivity starts with monomers and comonomers entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\nIncluded activities end: Activity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Coverage of production capacity in Europe: 76%\nStart date: 01/01/2011\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Data was collected for the year 2011, processed in 2013 and published in 2014\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 9/19/2018 9:57:30 AM\nLast edited: 1/10/2019 9:25:51 AM\nSource: 13f5ec09-b1e6-538f-95b4-780399213404_66ca2f38-5e51-4546-83c0-d7cef0c55c7c.spold\nUUID: 13f5ec09-b1e6-538f-95b4-780399213404",

Agricultural inputs were detailed as to their composition and physical characteristics. Agricultural operations were characterized in terms of machinery (tractor and implement), type of fuel and specific consumption. Precipitation is enought to supply water to the crop, no extra water needed. Emissions from the agricultural process were estimated using the BRCalc/ICVCalc tool, developed by Embrapa Environment, which includes specific climate and soil databases for the 137 Brazilian agricultural mesoregions, in addition to databases of parameters related to agricultural crops, fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nThe main emission models adopted by BRCalc/ICVCalc derive from the references: Nemecek et al. (2015), IPCC (2019), Nemecek & Kagi (2007). It was used the model BRLUC (Donke et al., 2020) to estimate the LUC emissions; and the PestLCI Consensus V1.0, parameterized for Brazil, to estimate pesticide emissions.\n\nProduction volume: 11294683136 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: The dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides. It is assumed that no organic fertiliser is applied. The dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds for: limestone and gypsum application, application of plant protection product, planting with starter fertiliser, fertilising, combine harvesting and drying of grains. For other agricultural operations, the amount of fuel consumed and their emissions are estimated. The dataset also includes the transportation of products inside the farm: water, soil correctives and fertilisers from sheds to field and grain from field to truck. Furthermore, direct field emissions and land use change emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. The dataset doesn't include: seed treatment and bacterial seed inoculant (Rhyzobium sp. for nitrogen fixation from air), cleaning and storage of harvested grains. The activity ends after harvest at the farm gate.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of soybeans in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which is composed of the soybean regions of Cachoeira do Sul, Santa Rosa and Santiago. In these regions, soybean can be produced as a monoculture or in cropping systems, including other crops such as maize and wheat. When in a cropping system, land occupation, liming operation and limestone are allocated among the products of the system, adopting factors that consider the fraction of area and the occupation time. The average productivity is 2982 kg/ha, at 13% moisture.\n\nAgricultural operation was modelled based on the total diesel consumed to perform the operation and the emissions to air related to diesel burning.\nStart date: 01/01/2015\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 4.3.0.0\nCreated: 9/16/2022 6:15:03 PM\nLast edited: 9/16/2022 8:29:08 PM\nSource: ba68764f-fd7e-57bb-995b-e5fdb8797e69_deb4f70c-bf2a-4cd3-bc3b-c71af8820da3.spold\nUUID: ba68764f-fd7e-57bb-995b-e5fdb8797e69",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled.

This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively.

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Orange, fresh grade {ES}| orange production, fresh grade | Cut-off, U\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of orange, fresh grade (Navelina). Fresh grade oranges are meant for direct human consumption. The reference flow is the average Yield_ per ha and for the year 2000: Yield_ (30 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 4187 m3/ha). The data are representative for orange production, fresh grade (Navelina), in Spain (Ribera Alta and Ribera Baixa) used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 300-65-135 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 3.6 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 14 kg a.i./ha and 74.7 kg/ha of horticultural oil.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of fresh grade oranges produced in Spain amounts to 20.5% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing fresh grade oranges produced in Spain or the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.2 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 2889660672 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e.grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.

Data from Ecoinvent.\nCategory: Agricultural production, plant production\nProduct Name: Fruit de palmier a huile\nType of data: LCI, crop management sequence\nData status: restrictive\nLocation: MY (Malaysia)\nDocumentation from ecoinvent :\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe inventory for the cultivation of oil palms GLO on recently transformed land  is modelled on the basis of data from Malaysia. Machine usage is modelled with Malaysian processings and Swiss diesel consumptions. The average annual clear-cutting of primary forest associated with the cultivation of oil palms is calculated as land tenure, arable land (the replacement of plantations is considered without any effect).  The loss/gain in carbon from mineral soils/organic soils/biomass growth is calculated as \"carbon, organic, from soil or biomass stock\" and released as \"carbon dioxide, from soil or biomass stock\". Transports are calculated with standard distances. The functional unit is 1 kg palm fruit bunches (fresh mass with a water content of 47 %). Carbon content: 0.313 kg/kg fresh mass. Biomass energy content: 16 MJ/kg fresh mass. Yield: 24978 kg/ha. The emissions of N2O and NH3 to air are calculated with standard emission factors for mineral fertilizers from Nemecek et al. 2004. The emission of nitrate to water is calculated with an estimated nitrogen loss factor of 20%.\n[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\nProduction volume: 90935000000 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts after the provision of land tenure, arable land, which is provided by the clear-cutting of rainforest. This activity assumes palm fruit bunch production on a plantation with a lifetime of 20 years and represents the average operation expenditures of the production of 1 kg of fresh fruit bunch averaged across the whole lifetime including establishment, operation and clearing of the plantation. The inputs of mineral fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water are considered. The input of seed is considered neglectable compared to the plantation lifetime of 20 years. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\nIncluded activities end: The dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Most operations are done by hand. Machine operations are: fertilisation, irrigation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, transport of harvested fruit bunches from field to farm (25 km) and clearing of the plantation (wood chopping). Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after harvest and transport to the farm at the farm gate.\nEnergy values: Net Values (default)\nGeography: The inventory refers to Malaysia\nTechnology level: 3 Current (default)\nTechnology: Cultivation of oil palms.\nStart date: 2002-01-01\nEnd date: 2014-12-31\nIs data valid for entire period: true\nTime period: Time of publications\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\nVersion: 3.0.2.0\nCreated: 2012-10-18T14:38:50\nLast edited: 2014-06-12T15:38:18\nSource: 439962b5-2fee-453b-a558-c7877ad36109_6dc2a920-b5e0-414c-9693-87b95f60d062.spold",

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.\n\nThis is the market for  'potato starch', in the Global geography.\n\nIn this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.\n\nThe product 'potato starch' is a processed agricultural product with a water content of 20% by weight. The production steps include washing of the potatoes, chopping, separation of the potato fruit water, washing, refinering and finally drying of the starch.\n\nProduction volume: 4 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'potato starch',  within the geography of Global.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the supply of 'potato starch',  to the consumers of this product.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "This dataset represents the production of 1 tonne of dried red kidney bean (<15% moisture) during May-September, 2020, at 1765.24 ha red kidney bean farms located in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Yield values were averaged over 2018-2020, and farms have an average yield of 2696.50 kg grain (<15% moisture) per ha for these crop cycles. The system boundaries include the production of all crop inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, crop protection products, and fuel) and consider nitrogen credits derived from biological N fixation associated with dried red kidney bean production. Irrigation is included. The sowing date for the crop is May 2020 and the harvesting date is September 2020. The seeding rate is 33.40 kg/tonne of red kidney bean production. Fertilizer applied contain nitrogen (as N) 18.25 kg/tonne, phosphate (as P2O5) 8.29 kg/tonne, potash (as K2O) 24.09 kg/tonne, and sulfur (as S) 2.48 kg/tonne. Predominant crop protection applied contain active ingredients of glyphosate 0.018 kg/tonne, bentazon 0.13 kg/tonne, and prothiconazole 0.018 kg/tonne. Machinery is used for tillage, fertilizer application, pre-plant herbicide application, planting, rolling, post-emergent herbicide application, inter-row cultivating/scuffing/hilling, fungicide application, pre-harvest desiccation, pull/undercut/knife, windrow/swathing, harvesting, and other with total fuel consumption of 21.03 kg/tonne.\n\nProduction volume: 4759970.555238 kg\nIncluded activities start: Starting inputs for this activity include seed, fertilizer, crop protection products and fuel on the farm. This activity begins with soil preparation about 39 weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in last week of May and the sowing of seeds started about 5 days after soil preparation.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with navy bean drying to <15% moisture at farm gate. This takes place in September, 17 weeks after the activity starts. The activity includes the infrastructures and use of agricultural machinery\n\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Ontario\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Production of red kidney bean includes farm practices from tillage, fertilizer application, pre-plant herbicide application, planting, rolling, post-emergent herbicide application, inter-row cultivating/scuffing/hilling, fungicide application, pre-harvest desiccation, pull/undercut/knife, windrow/swathing, harvesting, and other field activities, to aeration and drying.\nStart date: 01/01/2020\nEnd date: 31/12/2024\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Soil cultivating date for the main crop: May 2020; Harvesting date for the main crop: September 2020. Total time from the date of sowing to the date of harvesting comes to 17 weeks. Yield data were collected and averaged for three crop cycles (2018-2020).

Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.\n\nThe geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.\n\nSum of regional production volumes: 1.667e+10 kg\n\nCN: PV = 1.590e+10 kg; weight = 0.9539\n\nNL: PV = 5.088e+8 kg; weight = 0.03052\n\nIL: PV = 2.599e+8 kg; weight = 0.01559\n\nYield of the global dataset = 35996.3522492 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional Yield_s.\n\nThe comments below were part of the CN regional dataset.\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of carrots. The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 35 t/ha. The data are representative for carrot production in China used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 130-40-40 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 6 m3/ha of liquid manure and 5 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 4.3 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of carrots produced in China amounts to 23% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing carrots produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.8 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 18370729984 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of the carrots and their transport to the farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Rest-of-World\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 8.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 6/23/2016 1:43:54 PM\nSource: ddeb35ee-c0f2-5574-aab9-b73d097c1477_ed50040b-8630-4560-9b12-dd6cb2c9d741.spold\nUUID: ddeb35ee-c0f2-5574-aab9-b73d097c1477",

Machine use and infrastructure are excluded as most of the work is assumed to be manual work. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation and planted trees are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered.\n\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of coconut after manual dehusking at the farm. The co-product \"Coconut husk, at farm\" in included in the inventory.  The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2009 - 2012: yield (4.4 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 3076 m3/ha). System boundary: an average year of the productive phase is regarded; included are also the per year of lifetime calculated emissions for nursery, materials for planting, establishment and clearing phase; at farm without storage. Number of years from planting to clearing (lifetime): 60 years. Tree density: 175 trees/ha.   - Waste treatment after clearing of the orchard: Wooden posts and tree wood go to incineration, concrete posts go to land fill, iron wires go to recycling. The data are representative for coconut production in Philippines used for the export market. Economic allocation between the coconut and the husk is considered, with allocation factors from the Agri-Footprint 1.0 \"Economic allocation\" database (i.e. 93% to the coconut, 7% to the husk).\nTechnology: Conventional production.\n\nComment: Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for the Philippines. The original land use of 96.8 % of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. To avoid a potentially significant underestimation of land use change impacts, the conservative assumption was made that the unknown land transformation share shall be attributed to transformation from forest land (primary and secondary).\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 2.2 (i.e. good quality)",

'Country & land use unknown'. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nProduction volume: 3840904960 kg\nIncluded activities start: From maintenance of the orchards after harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with harvest and storage. \nThe dataset includes a storage period of 0.9 month and it's use of electricity. The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). Mercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included. \nThe dataset doesn't include infrastructure for production and storage facilities. No transports for agricultural means of production from the regional storage to the farm are included.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Global\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Production without production standard, but according to GAP\nStart date: 01/01/2010\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 9.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/5/2011 9:20:47 AM\nLast edited: 7/22/2016 11:03:50 AM\nSource: 278ae96b-7852-59bc-83f6-b916ca4400bd_dea57f7f-311e-4659-acde-df219917df6c.spold\nUUID: 278ae96b-7852-59bc-83f6-b916ca4400bd",

For the 3 processes, the machineries have been excluded since we consider a lifetime of 10 years for the appliances, and a large batch size.\n_Frying : The process includes electricity consumption and cooking oil consumption. It does not include air emissions life-cycle, by lack of data. The appliance life-cycle was excluded from the scope.\n_Boiling : The process includes electricity consumption and cooking oil consumption. It does not include air emissions life-cycle, by lack of data.  The appliance life-cycle was excluded from the scope.\nThe process includes electricity consumption. It excludes air emission due to lack of data. The appliance life-cycle was excluded from the scope.\nIn the development of Agribalyse 3.0, the upstream life-cycle stages of the food product, downstream life cycle stages and packaging from gate to consumer are added separately.\n\n_Energy consumption : The energy consumption data was found consistent with basic thermal calculations based on BREF generic data. For boiling (blanching), the energy consumption for gas boiling has been averaged between the data presented for potato blanching and the data presented for pasta boiling (Fusi et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2012). For frying, the energy consumption has been extracted from a study on potato frying as French fries (Mouron et al., 2016).\n_Additional ingredients : Additional ingredients accounted for are tap water, for boiling, and rapeseed oil, for frying.\n_Emissions : Emissions to air (water from boiling) and emissions to water are included for boiling process\n_Waste management : or the frying process, used oil is collected separately to be purified. According to the decree on 12th July 201, the collection of used cooking oil is mandatory in order to recycle it (Legifrance, 2011). In January 2016, the obligation threshold was lowered at 60 tons per year, meaning this obligation is applicable to a large amount of food industries.  We used the ecoinvent dataset: \"Used vegetable cooking oil, purified (FR) treatment of used vegetable cooking oil, purification, Cut-off, U - Copied from Ecoinvent\". The geographical scope for the ecoinvent dataset is French specific and covers all the end of life process: collection, transport, effluent treatment, storage and credits for the recovered oil. Other solid wastes are out of scope (Appliances at end of life and maintenance and cleaning material).\n_Transport : we used \"market for\" datasets already (transportation already included in these datasets). \n_",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project.

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\nThis dataset is gate-to-gate and covers all stages from peeled fruit or vegetable to canned fruit or vegetable: slicing of fruit or vegetable, can filling and sterilization. It is assumed to take place in France. Consequently, all datasets are chosen for France and Europe, when not available for France.\nThe figure below represents the life cycle boundaries.\nThe downstream stages from plant gate to consumer are out of scope, in accordance with the Agribalyse 3.0 methodology. The following stages are excluded from the system:\no The washing of fruit and vegetable prior to canning (excluded in Agribalyse 3.0 LCIs)\no The production and EoLof packaging, included elsewhere in upstream or downstream LCIs in Agribalyse v3.0\n\nThe figure represents the system modelling.\n\nA review of bibliography has been done to collect data on canning processes, along with an interview with a French canning process expert. The expert reviewed and validated the data collected from literature. Our research on vegetables led to compiling five studies, calculating the average electricity, steam and water consumption for each step of the canning process. For fruits, we reviewed the data for peach canning, which amounted to a single study (Folinas et al., 2015). The data was considered not robust enough, leading to excluding fruit canning from the scope of the model.\n_From the bibliography and the interview with a canning expert, we derived the energy consumptions for the vegetable canning process see section 8. One study provided the total energy consumption for canning (steam and electricity), it was used as a reference (Rao, 1977).  As explained previously, considering that water and steam circulates in a closed loop throughout the process, only the energy for pumping and heating water has been considered in the modelling of the water circuit.\n_The canning process involves water and steam consumption. However, according to the data provided by our canning process expert, water and steam are processed within a closed loop. Thus, water consumption for steam, cooling and other processes was not included in the scope. In order to calculate the water quantity in the cans, we calculated an average among data from Openfoodfacts website (Google Play app, 2019)\n_In the Cradle to Consumer Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Accounting of Sweet Corn in Minnesota (Miller, 2017) considers the addition of 7,27 g of salt per kg of canned corn. This value has been adopted after validation by our canning expert.\n_The food losses at the sub-steps of the process have not been modelled. The loss are modelled at a global process level. Therefore, a 1% default loss rate is applied at the end of the process. This is a conservative approach since all flows are augmented by 1%. The resulting waste (food, water and salt) are included in the inventory.\n_Emissions are related to solid waste due to the global product loss. Consequently, 1% of input food, water and salt are treated at the end of life.\n_ Transportation is not modelled in the inventory, as it is already accounted for in the electricity and salt inventories. The electricity inventory is an ecoinvent \"market\" inventory accounting for electricity transportation, and the salt Acyvia inventory relies on an ecoinvent sodium chloride \"market\" inventory.\n_ The packaging life cycle is not included. The future practitioner will be in charge of adding the appropriate packaging manufacture and end of life, as well as the 1% loss rate related to the canning process.",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,75; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 2; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 2; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 3; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 2; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,5; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 2; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,75; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 2; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 2; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on farm. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation water and seedlings are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered. Also regarded are the first two years of the non-productive phase, i.e.planting (manually), soil cultivation (plough), fertilisation (manure) and PE foil.\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of asparagus. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year for the reference period of 2009 - 2012 (i.e. 5.3 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (4089 m3/ha total amount water). System boundary: an average year of the productive phase is regarded. Included are also the two non-productive years. Asparagus has a lifetime of 9 years and 7 years in the productive phase. The data are representative for asparagus production in China based on average data over the country.\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 2.7 (i.e. good quality)",

The cows are kept in a free stall barn where milking is done in a parlour system. The farm operates on 72 ha of land that is very fertile and can also be used for cash crops. About 56 percent of the work on the farm is done by family members.\n\nAllocation between milk and meat (live animals) based on bio-physical causality (IDF 2015)\nInventory is for 1 kg raw milk, uncorrected. Mass produced is given for FPCM equivalent (IDF 2015)\nCo-product is beef cattle, from dairy farm (culled cows and male calves).\n\nIncluded: all feed inputs, pasture and pasture-related emissions, enteric emissions.\nExcluded: milking, farm infrastructure and energy/water consumption, manure management, packaging, transport for raw milk collection.\n\nHence the raw milk archetypes datasets are intended to be used in the raw milk national mix datasets, where manure management, farm processes and local peat degradation are also combined. The inventory is presented for 1 kg uncorrected raw milk, but the output quantity is corrected to correspond to 1 kg of FPCM.\n\n1 kg FPCM (fat and protein corrected milk)\n1 kg LW (live weight) beef cattle, from dairy farm\nMilk yield = 8810 kg year-1 cow-1\nNumber of dairy cows per farm = 154\nNumber of heifers per farm = 118 (avg)\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 ( i.e. very good quality)",

Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.\n\nThe geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.\n\nSum of regional production volumes: 8.329e+8 kg\n\nCA: PV = 5.526e+8 kg; weight = 0.6635\n\nRU: PV = 2.803e+8 kg; weight = 0.3365\n\nThe comments below were part of the CA regional dataset.\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of linseed grains. The average Yield_ from 2003-2004 is 1.3 t/ha at standard water content required for storage (10%). The data are representative for linseed production in western Canada used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 60-10-0 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 4 m3/ha of liquid manure and 3 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 1.69 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of linseed grains produced in Canada amounts to 59% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing linseed grains produced in Canada for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 1231968256 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of grains at farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include a) emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production and b) drying due to lack of data.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Rest-of-World\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2003\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 02df89d7-d27c-5153-bd04-e4a46c215702_9d858a25-0611-42a3-a3ec-716d50d7a774.spold\nUUID: 02df89d7-d27c-5153-bd04-e4a46c215702",

    "comment": "Translated name: Peach, at farm (WFLDB 3.5)\nIncluded processes: The inventory includes all activities of a year in the productive phase of the orchard, i.e. fertiliser and pesticide application, mulching, mowing, harvesting and irrigation. Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on the farm. Direct field emissions from crop production activities and from land use change are considered. The establishment phase of the orchard, i.e. tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of peach. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year for the reference period of 2009-2012: yield (15 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (water use for irrigation 7058 m3/ha). System boundary: an average year of the productive phase is regarded; included are also the per year of lifetime calculated emissions for nursery, materials for planting, establishment and clearing phase; at farm without storage. Number of years from planting to clearing (lifetime): 19 years   - Waste treatment after clearing of the orchard: Wooden posts and tree wood go to incineration, concrete posts go to land fill, iron wires go to recycling. The data are representative for peach production in China used for the export market.\nComment: Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 2.7 (i.e. good quality).\n\nTechnology: Conventional production\nVersion: 2.2\nEnergy values: Undefined\nLocal category: Landwirtschaftliche Produktion\nLocal subcategory: Pflanzenbau\nSource file: ES_WFLDB_PeachCN_22062015.xml",

Drying is not applied systematically (assumption 10% of Yield_ is dried). Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on farm. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation and seeds are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered.\nRemark: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg of sunflower grains, at standard water content required for storage (9%). The reference flow is the average Yield_ per ha and year, from 2006 - 2010, which is 2.4 t/ha with an average irrigation of 24 m3 water/ha (4% of the sunflower fields are irrigated irrigated, receiving 600 m3/ha water).

The data are representative for olive production in Spain (Andalusia) used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 60-60-60 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 2.15 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of olives produced in Spain amounts to 37% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing olives produced in Spain for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.5 (i.e. excellent quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 6.45975425E9 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (40 years, 250 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Spain\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2024\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 8.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/16 11:12:22\nSource: 5b088c7b-f181-55a9-9323-f811ff25a028_e580a34c-42e2-460d-ac2e-a49bcf0583f2.spold\nUUID: 5b088c7b-f181-55a9-9323-f811ff25a028",

'Country & land use unknown'. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991.

It also includes the electricity use in the greenhouse. And an average amount of heating energy for the production and the seedling production is included. The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). \nMercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included.

The reference flow is the average Yield_ per ha and year, from 2006 - 2009: Yield_ (165 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 4748 m3/ha). The data are representative of loose classic tomatoes for fresh consumption, produced in Spain (Almeria) for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 798-506-1562 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 32.3 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of fresh grade tomatoes produced in Spain amounts to 10.4 % of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010).

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled.

    "comment": "This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of Sweet Corn (fresh matter) in the US state of Minnesota at farm, with an at harvest moisture content of 76.%. This dataset includes cultivation of the field prior to planting, field treatments, planting, applications of nutrients and pesticides, and harvest. Residues are not collected but remain on the field post-harvest and overwinter.\n\nThe average yield of Sweet Corn grown in Minnesota for the 2014-2021 seasons was 16,813 kg/ha (wet mass) (USDA NASS (2022a)).  The dataset reflects the average Sweet Corn produced in Minnesota from 2014 to 2021, inclusive, as that period allows for at least one value from USDA statistics for most parameters and generally three or more.  Seed establishment and weed control for sweet corn generally require tillage (EPA 2022; IPM 2003, IPM 1997), so this dataset reflects sweet corn production using conventional tillage practices (0% no till, 0% reduced till, 100% conventional tillage) (EPA 2022; IPM center 2003; IPM center 1997 data) and being grown in rotations with other vegetable crops. While genetically engineered sweet (fresh) corn seed is available, the share of sweet (fresh) corn grown from genetically engineered seed is not compiled; it is estimated that between 75 and 90% of North American sweet corn is conventional (USDA 2018b).\n\nArea, productivity, use of mineral and organic fertilisers and pesticides, and irrigation inputs are based on farmer data reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture where possible or budgets available for the state, unless otherwise noted. Field operations and equipment types and fuel use are based on materials provided to growers by the agricultural extension office(s), including farm budgets, and on survey information agricultural extension office(s) collect from growers, in conjunction with row spacing data from USDA.  57.6% of crop land has installed drainage (tile or ditch), based on state-level agricultural survey data from USDA.  Irrigation is included based on share of crop irrigated (13.5% over the time period, USDA NASS (2018d)).\n\nTotal cropland land use, for all crops, in Minnesota increased by 1% between 1997 and 2017 (NRCS 2020); USDA NASS does not report cropped area for Sweet Corn prior to 2016.\n\nSoil characteristics, including pH, are based on distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples. No anti-erosion practices are assumed in the dataset; instead, the erosion soil loss reported in the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service's Natural Resource Inventory is used.\n\nReferences:\n\nUSDA NASS (2022a) Area, Production, Yield by State - Sweet Corn - 2016-2022.

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Coffee, green bean {IN}| coffee green bean production, arabica | Cut-off, U\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of green coffee beans (Arabica). Arabica is a variety of coffee that has a sweeter, softer taste, with tones of sugar, fruit, and berries. It has a higher acidity but twice less caffeine compared to Robusta beans, and is generally considered to be of higher quality compared to Robusta. Arabica is mostly grown in Latin America and India. The reference flow is the average Yield_ per ha and year, from 2012 - 2014: Yield_ (725 kg/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 352 m3/ha). The data are representative for Arabica green coffee beans production in India (Karnataka state) used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 900-0-0 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 0.15 kg a.i./ha and 3.7 kg/ha of neem oil.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of coffee produced in India amounts to 3.4% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing Arabica green coffee beans produced in India for the export market. \n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.2 (i.e. good quality)\n\nThis dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 91972128 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e.grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Green coffee beans are sun-dried.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for India\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2012\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 5/30/2016 12:50:07 PM\nSource: 56969a4f-b940-5542-9b88-e1b43d81da5c_42193bba-bf84-4490-8c69-b6e23048e73d.spold\nUUID: 56969a4f-b940-5542-9b88-e1b43d81da5c",

The data are representative for tea production in China used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 35-10-10 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 10.63 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of tea produced in China amounts to 15% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing tea produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 3.2 (i.e. fair quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 1.572053E9 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), and the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: fertiliser and pesticide application, and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n   Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for China\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2024\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 9.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/16 11:12:22\nSource: 772f9f84-0207-5174-89bb-154355908d31_1942f3d1-fad9-43da-a657-d5920c804cd6.spold\nUUID: 772f9f84-0207-5174-89bb-154355908d31",

Rapport méthodologique : volet emballages Agribalyse 3.2.\n\nThe inventory refers to a \"PP pot\" and the associated elements allowing to condition a weight of 200g of cocktail sausages. \nApplication to other cases: This inventory of packaging solution can only be used for products in sub-category \"Cocktail sausages\" (PACK_AGB) : refer to the report for more details. This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside the sub-category \"Cocktail sausages\" (PACK_AGB).\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing of two references and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nTwo references were weighed to best represent the French market. They are marketed both under own brand and under private label.\nThe weight of 200g of product used was obtained by averaging two references of 200g each. The weight of the packaging corresponds to the average of the weighed packaging.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 48.2 t/ha. The data are representative for pear production in Belgium used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 36-0-21 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 2.56 m3/ha of liquid manure and 1.71 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 26.15 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of pear produced in Belgium amounts to 12% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing pear produced in Belgium for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 3.0 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 277274240 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (21 years, 2357 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Belgium\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 7.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: 0b7ef9ff-f6c6-5386-a8de-ab1b0efaefc2_fb2a172f-2a59-4990-b362-64dd4825550f.spold\nUUID: 0b7ef9ff-f6c6-5386-a8de-ab1b0efaefc2",

Farms have Yield_ of 1701.66 kg dried matter per ha for this crop cycle. The system boundaries include the production of all of crop inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, crop protection products, and fuel). There is an estimated 0.49 kg of N fixation per tonne of lentils produced in this region that can be included as an avoided use of N fertilizer for the next crop in the rotation. However, this was not included in this model due to data presentation restrictions. Irrigation is not included since it is rarely performed for lentils in this region. Sowing date for the crop is May, 2019 and harvesting date is August, 2020. Seeding rate is 0.06 kg/tonne of lentil production.

The soil is prepared for cultivation in 1st week of May and sowing of seeds started about 5 days after soil preparation.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with lentil drying to <16% moisture at farm gate. Carbon and nitrogen emissions associated with above- and below-ground biomass are accounted for using the DNDC model. This model was also used to calculate a nitrogen fixation credit that can be included as an avoided use of N fertilizer for the next crop in the rotation.

Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.\n\nThis is the market for  'sodium chloride, powder', in the Global geography.\n\nTransport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\n'sodium chloride, powder'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007647-14-5. It is called 'sodium chloride' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: NaCl. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and appears as a white crystalline solid. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products, fertilisers, anti-freeze products, perfumes and fragrances and water treatment chemicals. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: formulation of mixtures and/or re-packaging, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, chemicals, mineral products (e.g. plasters, cement) and electrical, electronic and optical equipment.\n\nProduction volume: 3481869824 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'sodium chloride, powder',  within the geography of Global.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the supply of 'sodium chloride, powder',  to the consumers of this product.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 3; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 2; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 5; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

'Country & land use unknown'. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nProduction volume: 3.840905E9 kg\nIncluded activities start: From maintenance of the orchards after harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with harvest and storage. \nThe dataset includes a storage period of 0.9 month and it's use of electricity. The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). Mercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included. \nThe dataset doesn't include infrastructure for production and storage facilities. No transports for agricultural means of production from the regional storage to the farm are included.\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Global\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Production without production standard, but according to GAP\nStart date: 01/01/2010\nEnd date: 31/12/2024\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 11.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/5/11 9:20:47\nLast edited: 10/29/24 2:32:14\nSource: 0a3b111a-16c4-5b5d-b3d5-5abb9d6e36e4_dea57f7f-311e-4659-acde-df219917df6c.spold\nUUID: 0a3b111a-16c4-5b5d-b3d5-5abb9d6e36e4",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Rape seed {Canada without Quebec}| rape seed production | Cut-off, U\n\nAdaptation in AGB 3.3 to be a better proxy for mustard (the main proportion of the mustard seeds comes from canada, and rape seed and mustard is quiet similar in term of cultures): \n- mustard culture is not a GMO and most of the time the herbicide is not glufosinate, the replacement of \"glufosinate\" by \"pesticide unspecified\" has been done (as input of the technosphere and emission to soil)\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of rapeseed, at standard water content required for storage (8%). The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 1.9 t/ha. Data are representative for rapeseed production in western Canada, that represents 80% of fields in Canada, used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 85-20-0 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 3.27 m3/ha of liquid manure and 2.33 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 1.03 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of rapeseed produced in Canada amounts to 44% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing rapeseed produced in Canada for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.3 (i.e. excellent quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 13809125376 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of grains and their transport to the farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation (a mixture of no tillage and minimum tillage), sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, grain drying, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include a) emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production and b) irrigation because rapeseed is normally not irrigated in western Canada.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Canada without Quebec\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 12/20/2022 4:10:33 PM\nSource: a0e47b68-7da3-5d3a-b2d7-ea7a2763f8f1_cb09bcae-b469-4f41-84a6-cdd1e958e027.spold\nUUID: a0e47b68-7da3-5d3a-b2d7-ea7a2763f8f1",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled.

Reels of Fluting Medium and Linerboard are fed into a machine which is called a Corrugator (FEFCO, 2018). In integrated plants such as the ones represented here, the finished board is further folded into boxes.\n\nhttps://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/fb7c96f2-1933-4a81-a33a-515d0a5fb151 [Image URL, right click copy paste to a browser to view]\n\nThe data on corrugated board production are based on 389 plants (mostly integrated plants with corrugated board and box production on the same site) in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Together they produced 12,100,000 tonnes saleable product, which is 54% of the total annual production of corrugated board products in Europe. Each of the production sites produces on average 31.100 tonnes of corrugated sheets, ranging from 5.000  500.000 tonnes each. Reference(s): https://www.fefco.org/sites/default/files/documents/LCA%20Report%202019_revised_%20p%2037.pdf, accessed September 2022.\n\nFor this dataset the European average of recycled and virgin paper inputs (wellenstoff, semichemical fluting, kraftliner, testliner) was used.\n\nThe following air emissions were reported in the study: CO2 (fossil), CO, NOx (as NO2), SOx (as SO2), particulates (all sizes).\n\nFor a more complete air emission profile, additional air emissions (beyond the ones listed above) were added for the combustion of the external fuels and internal using LCI datasets for combustion of different fuels as proxy. The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the external fuels in the study and more information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\".\n\nThe production volume is valid for the year 2018. Inventory data were collected for the year 2018.\n\nProduction volume: 24306999296 kg\nIncluded activities start: The process starts as reels of Fluting Medium and Linerboard are fed into a machine called a Corrugator.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with folded corrugated board boxes ready for delivery.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Europe\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Average of present used technology\n\nThe Fluting Medium paper is conditioned with heat and steam and fed between large corrugating rolls that give the paper its fluted shape in the Single Facer. Starch is applied to the tips of the flutes on one side and the inner liner is glued to the fluting. The corrugated fluting medium with liner attached to it is called single face web and travels along the machine towards the Double Backer where the single face web meets the outer liner and forms corrugated board. A number of layers of single faced web may be built up to produce double and triple wall corrugated board. The corrugated board is slit into the required widths and cut into sheets which are then stacked or palletised. The final stage of the process consists of printing and then slotting, folding and gluing the corrugated board to manufacture a corrugated box.\nStart date: 01/01/2018\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 4.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/31/2022 8:55:02 AM\nLast edited: 8/15/2022 1:20:58 PM\nSource: aefe6f41-eeb4-5d24-8d8a-bfc4777b1ee5_ca213807-7c00-4537-ac8c-23d39d0f2bd5.spold\nUUID: aefe6f41-eeb4-5d24-8d8a-bfc4777b1ee5",

No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 6.03 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of carrots produced in the Netherlands amounts to 19% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010).

The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included.The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.

The data are representative for onion production in the Netherlands used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 100-120-19 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 14.85 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of onions produced in the Netherlands amounts to 20% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing onions produced in the Netherlands for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.2 (i.e. good quality).

The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

Rapport méthodologique : volet emballages Agribalyse 3.2.\n\nThe inventory refers to a plastic bag  and the associated elements making it possible to condition a total weight of 270 g (format) of sandwich.\nThis packaging solution inventory can only be used for products in the \"Sandwich\" subcategory (PACK_AGB): refer to the report for more details. This inventory cannot be used to represent the same type of packaging for other products outside of the \"Sandwich\" subcategory (PACK_AGB)\n\nThe data was produced from study of packaging on the French market (supermarket reference), weighing and CTCPA packaging expertise.\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE)\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html \n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 2; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 4; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France.

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991.

The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%).

Ratio Yield_ Costa Rica to Kenya is 2,40 (Yield in Thaïland : 35813kg/ha), thus the occupation, annual crop has been adapted with the Yield_ ratio. Field operations are linked to the work rate expressed in hours/hectare. As the Yield_ is lower in Kenya, the operations are on larger surfaces: adaptation of the diesel consumed and of the land use change by multiplying by the ratio.\n\"",

These datasets have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\n\nTime period: Inventory data based on 2023 \" Plein Pot Sur les Emballages \" (PPSE) data (data from ADEME and Open Food Facts)\n\nUse of \"PPSE\" data to improve packaging modelling for products not covered by the \"PACK AGB\" project. Data verified by CTCPA's packaging expert.\n\nGeneral assumptions\n\nFor \"PPSE\" missing data, assumptions are based on CTCPA expertise \nSome multi-layer packaging (identified by CTCPA's expert) are modeled using a packaging solution from PACK AGB project. Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Cow milk {CA-QC}| milk production, from cow | Cut-off, U\n\nThis dataset represents the production of conventional milk from dairy cows, in Québec (Canada), in 2009-2011. The module includes the consumption of feed, and the operation of cattle housing systems for the management of the dairy herd and the production of cow milk. The functional unit is 1 kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) raw milk from Québec dairy farms. The FPCM correction is made for a conversion to a 4.0% fat and 3.3% true protein content, following the equation provided by the International Dairy Federation (IDF): FPCM (kg/yr) = Production (kg/yr) x [0.1226 x Fat% + 0.0776 x Protein% + 0.2534]. Live animals (culled cows and calves) sold for slaughterhing are by-products, as well as solid and liquid manure.\n\nhttps://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/f08a0b12-8f8b-4f1d-8b52-1d688403d0cc [Image URL, right click copy paste to a browser to view]\n\nThe average dairy farm in Québec produced 449400 L raw milk (at 4.06 kg/hL butterfat and 3.36 kg/hL protein), hence 469488 kg FCPM per farm. The average herd size over the year is: 57,7 milk cows (8137 kg FPCM/cow/year), 0.18 bulls, 0.39 young bulls, 1.11 veals male, 10.72 veals female, 12.56 bred heifers, 14.90 open heifers. Hence, the whole herd is worth 74 livestock units. 11 culled cows and 41 calves are sold for slaughter. The replacement rate is 32%. 91% of animals are housed in tie-stall systems, 9% in free-stall systems. With 6414 dairy farms, Québec milk production accounts for 38% of overall Canada production.\n\nThis dataset does not cover organic milk production in Quebec, which is marginal. 1.5% of overall Quebec dairy farms were organic-certified in 2010, and 1% of total milk produced in Québec in 2010 was organic milk (Fédération des Producteurs de lait du Québec; http://www.lait.org/en/interactive-faq/the-production.php). Furthermore, only 80% of organic milk ends up into organic-certified processed products (e.g. organic milk, yogurt, cheese)\n\n44% of the manure is managed as solid manure (35% solid stored; 9% stockpiled) and 56% managed as liquid manure (35% liquid in open-pit with crust formation; 8% liquid in covered pit; 8% liquid in open-pit without crust; and 5% liquid in lagoon). According to these management figures and to the distribution of animal categories within the herd, emissions to the air from manure management have been calculated (in kg/kg FPCM): N2O (direct+indirect): 5,7866E-04 kg; NH3: 5,5310E-04 kg; CH4: 5,5198E-03 kg.\n\nNone\n\nProduction volume: 3011295488 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts from the reception and storage of feed materials, and dairy herd housing.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the provision of milk at farm, ready-to-deliver. The dataset includes the consumption of feed; the livestock management operations (including bedding, drinking water, milking equipment, cleaning products and water, ammonia and dinitrogen oxyde emissions from housing, and methane emissions from enteric fermentation), manure management emissions; energy and buildings (including electricity for dairying, cattle housing and milk parlour equipment and buildings, and gasoline for regular operations) necessary for the operation of a typical dairy farm. The dataset does not include fodder and feed production and processing into meal for animals, litter production, manure management operations (however, emissions are accounted for); nor milk transportation beyond the farm gate (e.g. to dairy processing plants). Also, the dataset does not include particulate matter emissions, nor any drugs used on the dairy farm, because of the lack of data available on quantities and content. In terms of mass, drugs represent much less than 1% of inputs.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Québec\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Data and assumptions are intended to reflect current equipment, processes, and market conditions.\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: Period indicated in the reference. \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 12/27/2013 4:18:13 PM\nLast edited: 9/11/2015 9:22:02 PM\nSource: e57e3840-4395-53b5-ba24-eb7b672200cf_a3ee1ec6-ce17-430e-a475-f98f1b2890d2.spold\nUUID: e57e3840-4395-53b5-ba24-eb7b672200cf",

    "comment": "Reference flow: The functional unit is the production of 1 kg cured and dried vanilla.\n\nSystem Boundaries: Cradle-to-gate. This dataset covers the process of vanilla curing, including blanching, sweating, and drying of the green vanilla beans. The input green vanilla beans, as well as the energy and water use are included. Yield is 6.5 kg green beans per kg cured vanilla. Packaging is not included.\n\nGeography: Madagascar\n\nTechnology: Traditional bleaching, sweating and sun-drying as practiced in Madagascar and India and described in the following websites, accessed December 2018.\nhttp://www.varanashi.com/vanilla_processing.html\nhttp://www.provagourmet.us/the-vanilla-process\n\nIt is assumed that water heated for 30-kg batches amounts to 90 L, with 5% loss for each batch (evaporation and extracted with the beans, dried). Water is completed regularly and thrown away after 10 batches in a row (10 times 5% loss). So 90 L are used and returned to surface water, and 45 L are used in addition and evaporated / evacuated with the blanched beans and dried. Total 135 L for 300 kg dried beans.\nWater is heated with firewood from 20°C to 65°C, assuming 40% energy loss each batch (in addition to energy loss via water loss) because of the heat needed to heat the beans (0.33 kg/L, assuming similar heat capacity to water) and other losses. Firewood related LUC is ignored at this stage. The situation in Madagascar is critical in this regard, but firewood can be sourced from plantations planted on degraded land being restored, so refinement is needed.\n\nThe use of clean blankets is critical for the success of the sweating process. The cleaning is done in hot water with similar assumptions as above, plus the following: One blanket is used for each 30-kg batch (which becomes lighter while drying, obviously). Cleaning 1 blanket requires about 5 L of water at 70°C. 10% of that water is evaporated.\n\nShade drying is done in a room filled with wooden boxes (with 1 batch in each) and artificially ventilated 24x7 during 2 to 3 months. Assumptions are made on the number of boxes and the power of the ventilation system.\n\nTime: Data from 2010 - 2018\n\nData quality rating (DQR) = 2.7, Good quality",

Nota bene the packaging format may be different.\n\nAssumptions at each stage: \n\nProduction\n- Only the packaging material in contact with the product or ensuring the product's shelf life is modeled.\nFor example, in the case of cookies packaged in PP plastic bags (element 1), themselves packaged in a cardboard box (elements 2): (i) Element 2 is the heaviest / (ii) Element 1 is in contact with the product, so the PP material was taken into account.\n- For multi-element and multi-layer packaging, the inventory calls for the material in contact with the product and for the quantity, an assumption has been made to take of the packaging solution (sum of all elements) and consider this value for this material.\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative material.\n\nProcessing\n- Only the most representative process for the most representative packaging material is included.\nFor example, in the case of a multi-layer flexible film, only the extrusion process is modeled. The lamination process used to combine the various packaging layers was not included. \n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used for the most representative process.\n\nTransport\n- The assumptions of the PACK AGB project were applied\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material\n- Ratios from France and Europe compiled in the PACK AGB project by packaging material were used (ADEME data, 2020).\n\nEnd of life\n- All plastic packaging is considered non-recycled (R2=0%).\nTo be able to affirm that the plastic packaging is recycled, it is necessary to consider the whole packaging solution (with all the elements and materials) and in this project the dataset only include a part of the packaging (proxy)\n- Datasets created as part of the PACK AGB project were used, for the most representative packaging material. \n- The Circular FootPrint Formula was applied.\n\nGénérateurs : CTCPA\nVérificateurs : CTCPA (packaging expert from CTCPA)\nContact : Pauline AUDOYE (paudoye@ctcpa.org) ; Mathilde BRAMBATI (mbrambati@ctcpa.org) ; Margaux COLOMBIN(mcolombin@ctcpa.org)\nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nPropriété : ADEME",

The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 3.5 t/ha. The data are representative for peanut production in China used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 80-27-28 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 11.25 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of peanuts produced in China amounts to 10% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing peanuts produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 15861245952 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of peanuts at farm gate. The dataset includes total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown.

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Rice, non-basmati {CN}| rice production, non-basmati | Cut-off, U\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of rice grains, at standard water content required for storage (13.1%). The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 6.6 t/ha. The data are representative for a double rice cropping system in Southern China (Hunan province), representing the largest rice-producing province of China. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 72-23-26 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 3.55 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of rice produced in China amounts to 28% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing rice produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.7 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\n[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:\n\n - rice production, CN, 2009 - 2012 (18a7fdeb-0fa4-4d9b-a4b7-c96037c23593)]\n\nProduction volume: 211090817024 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the harvest of rice grains and subsequent burning of crop residues. A winter fallow is following the harvest of late rice, where no irrigation is applied. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: rotary tillage, the application of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation and harvesting, and on-farm transport. Rice seedlings are transplanted manually by throwing the seedlings in the standing water. Paddy rice is grown under flooded conditions (~40-50 mm water depth) for the entire growing season except for the aeration stage and one week prior to harvest (i.e. ~80 days under flooded conditions per crop cycle). Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. In the considered region of China, rice is produced in a double rice cropping system (two crop cycles). Therefore, an average of the two crop cycles was used for the considered inputs. The inputs of seeds, irrigation water, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include a) grain drying, as no information was available and b) the production of rice seedlings (seeds are used as input). \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for China\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: Conventional production\nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 11/6/2018 11:49:47 AM\nLast edited: 3/12/2019 10:34:01 AM\nSource: 29831dc4-52e0-5867-ad93-c4c2405f62a7_922db745-4df5-4b82-bbb6-98e81e4007d1.spold\nUUID: 29831dc4-52e0-5867-ad93-c4c2405f62a7",

Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.\n\nThe geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.\n\nSum of regional production volumes: 2.257e+9 kg\n\nCN: PV = 1.572e+9 kg; weight = 0.6966\n\nKE: PV = 3.651e+8 kg; weight = 0.1618\n\nLK: PV = 3.197e+8 kg; weight = 0.1417\n\nYield of the global dataset = 1440.4 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional Yield_s.\n\nThe comments below were part of the CN regional dataset.\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of tea. The average Yield_ from 2009 - 2012 is 1.1 t/ha. The data are representative for tea production in China used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 35-10-10 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 10.63 kg a.i./ha.\n\nThe dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of tea produced in China amounts to 15% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing tea produced in China for the export market.\n\nPEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 3.2 (i.e. fair quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nProduction volume: 1436769536 kg\nIncluded activities start: This activity starts with the nursery producing tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\nIncluded activities end: This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), and the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: fertiliser and pesticide application, and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n   Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Rest-of-World\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2009\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 9.3.0.0\nCreated: 5/30/2016 11:12:22 AM\nLast edited: 6/23/2016 1:45:52 PM\nSource: 006744b2-04db-53aa-b425-7b2466dabd96_1942f3d1-fad9-43da-a657-d5920c804cd6.spold\nUUID: 006744b2-04db-53aa-b425-7b2466dabd96",

    "comment": "AGRIBALYSE v3.2 dataset, 2024.\noriginal ecoinvent name: Aluminium, primary, ingot {RoW}| aluminium production, primary, ingot | Cut-off, S\n\nThe dataset represents the production of 1kg of primary aluminium ingot. Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.\n\nFor more information on the process, please go to \n\nhttp://primary.world-aluminium.org/index.php?id=285\n\n[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nProduction volume: 2096486016 kg\nIncluded activities start: The unit process begins with the unloading of process material to their storage areas on site.  The operations covered by this dataset include:\n* pre-treatment of hot metal\n* recovery and handling of internal process scrap\n* batching, metal treatment and casting operations\n* homogenizing, sawing and packaging activities\n* maintenance and repair of plant and equipment\n* treatment of process air, liquids and solids.\n* production of infrastructure (through rough estimate) was also added.\nIncluded activities end: The output of this unit process is packaged aluminium ingots, wrought alloy.\nEnergy values: Undefined\nGeography: The inventory is modelled for Rest-of-World\nTechnology level: Current\nTechnology: \nStart date: 01/01/2015\nEnd date: 31/12/2022\nIs data valid for entire period: True\nTime period: \nMacro-economic scenario name: Business-as-Usual\n\nVersion: 6.3.0.0\nCreated: 12/6/2017 4:36:55 PM\nLast edited: 7/11/2018 10:44:28 AM\nSource: b62a4882-4502-546d-89e3-cc2fccd40e82_44defed2-3dc7-4d59-b3bc-23dacf1b9140.spold\nUUID: b62a4882-4502-546d-89e3-cc2fccd40e82",

The weight of the packaging corresponds to the average of the weighed packaging.\n\nThe inventory includes : (1) production of packaging materials***, (2) manufacture and finishing of packaging components, (3) intermediate transport from the production of materials to the packaging site, and (4) the end-of-life management of packaging*** as it takes place in France. ***Application of CCF, rate of virgin and recycled materials corresponding to the FR scenario (2022) \nThe inventory does not include distribution transport (integrated into the next stage at distribution in AGRIBALYSE).\n\nThe packaging solutions developed as part of the PACK_AGB project have not been developed for use in comparative LCAs of packaging solutions: if this is your purpose, we recommend that you follow the ADEME reference framework on comparative comparative LCA between different packaging solutions: https://librairie.ademe.fr/dechets-economie-circulaire/5309-cadre-de-reference-acv-comparatives-entre-differentes-solutions-d-emballages.html .\n\nOverall data quality : DQR= 1,25; Technological representativeness (TeR) = 1; Geographical representativeness (GR) = 2; Time-related representativeness (TiR) = 1; Precision (P material) = 1; Precision (P processing) = 1\nTime period: the data describing the packaging solution was collected over the period 2020-2022. \nThe inventory is modelled for France. Packaging waste management is representative of packaging waste management in France. \nProperty rights : OpenData, licence \"Ecolab\".  \nProperty data : ADEME",
