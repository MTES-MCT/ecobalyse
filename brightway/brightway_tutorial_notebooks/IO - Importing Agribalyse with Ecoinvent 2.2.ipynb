    "We have imported the Agribalyse database. In the process of importing, we found and resolved several problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we had to fix the names and categories of biosphere flow names, to make them compatible with the names and categories used in ecoinvent version 3.\n",
    "2. Next, we created a new database for the new biosphere flows that we couldn't match.\n",
    "3. We linked production flows to the activities that produced them, using a strategy that didn't use the field `categories`, as this field is not given consistently in SimaPro exports.\n",
    "4. We switched some outputs to inputs, to be consistent with how ecoinvent models disposal and recycling processes.\n",
    "5. We linked inputs to activities in ecoinvent 2.2, again ignoring the field `categories`, because SimaPro.\n",
    "6. We created new processes to provide recycling services.\n",
    "7. We deleted the unique identifying codes used by SimaPro, as they were not actually unique, and created our own codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a bit of a pain, but compared to other database exports, was actually not all that difficult. This is the sad truth of LCA data compatibility - it currently isn't all that great."
