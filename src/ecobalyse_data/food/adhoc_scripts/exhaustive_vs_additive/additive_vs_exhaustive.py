"""
Debug script to compute the impact of a ciqual product at every step according to 2 methods : 
- additive : impact_output = sum(impact_input) (biosphere flows at the step are neglected)
- exhaustive :  biosphere flows emitted at the step are taken into account (for example emissions of refrigerant gases for frozen food product at storage/supermarket)

Output: 
simplified_diff.xlsx
